======== Start =========
#event1
<npc=21, iammale, part=1>
Okay, let's get to work. We'll see how good those battle mages really are! 
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=1>
At last we can get to work! I'm anxious to demonstrate some overwhelming skill to those celebrated battle mages. 
<npc=22, part=2>
The cold steel of my weapon shall find its prey in this battle! If someone thinks that danger will stop me...think again!
<npc=23, part=3>
Oh no, no one doubts your courage. But we should remember the horrible slaughter of the companies who fought the mages before us.
<npc=23, part=4>
Normally it's you who calls for caution, but now I beg you: please don't take any unnecessary risks!

======== Final =======
#event2
<npc=22, part=1>
You were right, Dina. My battle would have been swift and unfortunate if I neglected to fight them without your support.
