====Starting conversation
#event1
<npc=22, part=1>
I have a suspicion that it's not going to be easy to convince the elf to hand over the Star. Everything I know about them isn't very encouraging.
<npc=23, part=2>
But I can ask him, beg him to listen to us. I hope that there are still some feelings in his ancient heart.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
Why do you worry so much? Elves are just normal guys. I know one...That is, I've seen his picture. Why don't we find him first and then see what happens?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
I'm afraid that those ancient elves aren't very sensitive. I have more hope for the intelligence of this elf than for his feelings. He must understand that this is a serious matter.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
I think we should appeal to the intelligence of this elf rather than to his feelings. He must understand that our business is very important!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
You may drown an elf in tears, darling, but he won't soften. Someone more experienced should convince him of the importance of our business!
<npc=22, iammale, part=4>
Well, since you're so confident, you should talk to him if Dina and I fail. 
<npc=22, iamfemale, part=4>
Well, since you're so confident, you should talk to him if Dina and I fail.

====Druid hangs a spy and tells about it.
#event2
<npc=686, part=1>
Beautiful flowers and poison ivy grow in the same forest. We are happy to welcome guests to the Woods, but we are also ready to deal with the unwanted ones.
<npc=686, part=2>
This man tried to sneak into the restricted part of the Woods, and he did not listen to our warnings. Now he will have a difficult time telling his masters of what he has found here.

====Hero talks to the elf mentioning Rood Glaen 
#event3
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=1>
Sir wise elf! I'm aware that your kind is somewhat unwilling to interact with humans... Well, completely unwilling actually, however, I ask that you listen to me!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
I am a resident of Uimoir, and I was sent here by Great Mage Skrakan, the same one who joined the elf Rood Glaen in his endeavor against the Demon!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Good day, sir elf! Would you mind sparing a moment for me? I know that your kind has no affection for humans, but you still can listen to me.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
I am a resident of Uimoir, and I was sent here by Great Mage Skrakan. The same one who destroyed the Demon with the elf Rood Glaen!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
I am happy to meet you, wise elf! I dare to request your attention in spite of the known lack of friendship between elves and humans.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
I am a resident of Uimoir, and I am here at the request of... more accurately, on a mission from Great Mage Skrakan. The same one who destroyed the Demon together with elf Rood Glaen! 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Greetings, elf! I don't expect courteousness. In fact, I know that your kind dislikes humans, but I will appreciate it if you listen to me.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
I was born on Uimoir, and I'm here because Great Mage Skrakan requested my assistance. He was the one who destroyed the Demon together with elf Rood Glaen.
<npc=2003, part=3>
I know who Rood Glaen and Skrakan are, and I know their story well. However, it was a special case, as the Demon threatened the whole world!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
So you aren't sure that it's special this time? You may be right, but I should tell you that Skrakan was very worried when he sent me here.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
Do you think that it's not important this time? Of course, I can't know all Skrakan's thoughts, but you have my word that he was very worried when he sent me here. 
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
I will not try to convince you that I am informed of all the thoughts of Great Skrakan.  However, I believe that the situation is no less complicated now. Please trust me!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=4>
I agree. But Skrakan wouldn't send me here if the situation were any less serious.
<npc=2003, part=5>
Perhaps, Skrakan is right...However, I have another problem now.
<npc=2003, part=6>
You were right when you mentioned that the elves have little interest in humans. But it wasn't always this way, and there were people who served us well.
<npc=2003, part=7>
They are long dead, and their bodies are buried in an ancient cemetery in the northern part of this forest. Some time ago the Necromancers came there to defile their graves.
<npc=2003, part=8>
I can not think or talk of anything else until this outrage is stopped!

====Igles talks to the elf and gets sent away
#event4
<npc=22, part=1>
I respectfully greet the wise elf. I would like to talk to you. It is... 
<npc=2003, part=2>
Don't waste my time, human. I have nothing to discuss with you, nor with any other man. 
<npc=22, part=3>
But my business is very important and it concerns every inhabitant of this Allod! Why don't you want to hear me?
<npc=2003, part=4>
For as long as I remember, humans never did anything of importance for the elves. Our races have different paths which never cross.

==== Dina talks to the elf and gets sent away 
#event5
<npc=23, part=1>
O wise elf! I want to ask you about one very important thing...
<npc=2003, part=2>
Don't waste my time, girl. I have nothing to discuss with you, nor with any other human.
<npc=23, part=3>
But my business is very important and it concerns every inhabitant of this Allod! Why don't you want to hear me?

====Elf gives the crown
#event6
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=1>
Forget your worries, sir elf! The Necromancers are scattered, and the cemetery enjoys its peace once again. Can we continue our conversation? 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
I have good news for you, elf. There is no one left to defile the ancient cemetery. Shall we continue our discussion? 
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
Good sir elf! I bear news that would certainly interest you. The Necromancers and their army are no longer present in the Ancient Woods. May we continue our conversation? 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
I am happy to inform sir elf that the ancient cemetery is peaceful once again. Can we continue our discussion?
<npc=2003, part=2>
This is good news indeed. We may have been wrong by rejecting assistance from other races. What is it you want, human?
<npc=21, part=3>
My friends and I must find and bring together the three Stars. Their fall was the omen of disaster, but there is hope that we can avert it by bringing all the Stars together!
<npc=2003, iammale, part=4>
Really? You did a good job with the Necromancers, but isn't the reward you want too big for yourself?
<npc=2003, iamfemale, part=4>
Really? You did a good job with the Necromancers, but isn't the reward you want too big for yourself?
<npc=21, iamfighter, part=5>
I need the Star not as a reward and certainly not for myself! If you are indeed as wise as elves are rumored to be, you should understand this! 
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=5>

<npc=2003, part=6>
Don't get excited, human. Even elves make mistakes too...However, your sincerity convinced me. Let the Fallen Star of the Ancient Woods go into worthy hands.

====Hero talks to the druids who can give monsters==
#event7
<npc=685, iammale, part=1>
Are you one of those humans who became guests of Great Saken-Maye? The word about you has reached the most secluded parts of the Ancient Woods! 
<npc=685, iamfemale, part=1>
Are you one of those humans who became guests of Great Saken-Maye? The word about you has reached the most secluded parts of the Ancient Woods! 
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
It's nice to hear sympathetic words after such a dangerous trip! I wish the wild beasts were so friendly...
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Thank you for warm greeting! It's pleasant to hear that the news about our adventures has travel across the Woods. I only wish the wild beasts could hear it as well. We almost got killed here!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
It is nice to hear sympathetic words after a dangerous trip! Unfortunately, the wild beasts do not care whether we are guests of the Woods or not.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
I'm thrilled with your words, especially since I had to risk my life to hear them. The wild beasts living next to you have no concept of hospitality.
<npc=685, part=3>
Of course, the wild beasts are not intelligent. However, some of them can distinguish friends and foes with our aid. You may notice that today.

<npc=23, part=2>
Thank you for warm greeting...I wish the wild beasts that I met on the way were equally hospitable! 
<npc=685, part=3>
Of course, the wild beasts are not intelligent. However, some of them can distinguish friends and foes with our aid. You may notice that today.

#event9
<npc=685, part=1>
Are you the Knight to whom Arafel-Faye revealed the path to our woods? It was a hasty decision of hers, in my opinion. We can not say we are happy to see you here.
<npc=22, part=2>
Take it easy...your feelings toward us are entirely reciprocated. First, I was nearly gnawed to death by the wild beasts in these woods, and now I have to listen to your platitudes as well!
<npc=22, part=3>
If I was spoken to like this in town, my honor would demand a duel!
<npc=685, part=4>
Duels are no practice of ours, Knight. We have no desire to attack you, but neither are we willing to help. Be content that we do not object to your presence here in our Woods!

Our quest is over! I am not a mage, but even I can feel the parts of the crown trying to pull together. I never dreamed of holding the real Crown of Yases!
#
======Dinh takes the last piece ======
#event12
<npc=23, part=1>
The parts of the Crown are trying to pull together...I can't believe that a mere country girl like myself will soon behold the Crown of Yases!
