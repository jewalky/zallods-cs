Tell me, Igles, how far is Teyrack's land? I came here to fight, not to hike!

<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
Dear friend Igles! I was wondering if you can tell me how far it is to Teyrack's land? I was expecting a fight rather than a hike!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Tell me, Igles, are we really going to fight or have you just invented an excuse to take us all for a hike? How far is Teyrack's land?
<npc=22, iammale, part=2>
We've just crossed the border. Be assured that we're not going to enjoy our little walk much longer!

<npc=21, part=1>
Greetings, good man! How's life treating you? 
<npc=2112, part=2>
I wouldn't call this a life. Sir Teyrack has never been good-hearted, but lately he completely went off his rocker.
<npc=2112, part=3>
Even being the headman here, I can't wait until someone comes here to destroy him.
<npc=21, part=4>
You aren't supposed to know this, good man, but you won't have to wait much longer. However, keep this to yourself right now.

Greetings, good sir!
<npc=22, part=2>
Hello. These lands belong to Teyrack, don't they?
<npc=2112, part=3>
They do, good sir! However, this isn't good news for you. If Teyrack learns about your presence, he may well order his men to kill you.
<npc=2112, part=4>
He never used to be hospitable, but lately he completely went out of his gourd! He gives us nothing but hard times and anguish...
<npc=22, part=5>
This is sad to hear. People such as Teyrack are a disgrace to the noble families. I'm not going to flee from his land today! I'm going to destroy him instead!

Greetings, good man! How's life going? 
<npc=2112, part=2>
I wouldn't call this a life. Sir Teyrack has never been good-hearted, but lately he completely went off out of his mind.

I always thought that the peasants hate to abandon their houses, but here we have quite a crowd. What are you doing here, away from your fields?

We just don't know what to do, good sir! Sir Teyrack's soldiers have occupied our village on the other side of the bridge, and kicked us out of the town!
<npc=2112, iamfemale part=2>
We just don't know what to do, good lady! Sir Teyrack's soldiers have occupied our village on the other side of the bridge, and kicked us out of the town!
<npc=21, part=3>
Well, it seems that Teyrack's having a bit of fun! But, as the saying goes, "he who laughs last, laughs last"...or something like that. It's time for Teyrack and his people to taste some misery for a change!

What is your grief, good people? What are you doing here, away from your fields? 
<npc=2112, part=2>
We just don't know what to do, lass! Sir Teyrack's soldiers have occupied our village on the other side of the bridge, and kicked us out of the town!
<npc=23, part=3>
This is unfair! But my friends and I have come to restore justice in this land. You shall return to your houses soon!
