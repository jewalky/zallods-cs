Yikes! What's that smell?
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
Yeah, it stinks all right...I bet a hundred gold coins to one that there are zombies around. And another hundred that there are lots of them!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
I don't like the breeze, either. I bet a thousand gold coins to two that the zombie army is nearby!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
The aromatic properties of the air have dramatically changed for the worse...Simply put, it stinks here! I bet a hundred to one that the zombies are nearby.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
It stinks rather than smells, darling! I should have thought to pack some strong perfume with me this morning...I bet that the zombie army is nearby!
<npc=22, part=3>
No one will take that bet, the enemies are close indeed. It's time to fight!

We are grateful to you, champion! We were preparing ourselves to die, but your timely arrival made us change our minds!
<npc=2122, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
We are grateful to you, beautiful amazon! We were preparing ourselves to die, but your timely arrival made us change our minds!
<npc=2122, iammale, iammage, part=1>
We are grateful to you, mage! We were preparing ourselves to die, but your timely arrival made us change our minds!
<npc=2122, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
We are grateful to you, fair lady! We were preparing ourselves to die, but your timely arrival made us change our minds!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
Oh, come on...I am far from becoming a champion yet.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Come on, come on...Stop that flattery before I get an attitude problem. I've already got a big enough ego as it is!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
Normally, a heroic death is the most worthless option in any situation. I have just humbly offered you another alternative.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
Your words are courteous. However, calling me "fair" right now sounds more like mockery. Let me get back to town, take a bath, do my makeup, then "fair" should apply!
<npc=2122, part=3>
Your modesty does not make our gratitude any smaller, but just adds to our respect. Keep in mind that you have new friends ready to stand by your side whenever you might need help!

<npc=2122, part=1>
We are grateful to you, sir Igles! We were preparing ourselves to die, but your timely arrival made us change our minds!
<npc=22, part=2>
I only did my duty. The mastery of the Necromancers on this Allod is getting out of hand. How could I fail to aid those who share my thoughts?
<npc=2122, part=3>
From now on we are your friends and servants. Whenever you need us, we shall stand by your side and carry out any order you may give!

<npc=2122, part=1>
We are grateful to you, lady! We were preparing ourselves to die, but your timely arrival made us change our minds!
<npc=23, part=2>
Oh, please don't...I haven't done anything to deserve such words...
<npc=2122, part=3>
Your modesty does not make our gratitude any smaller, but just adds to our respect. Keep in mind that you have new friends ready to stand by your side whenever you might need help!
