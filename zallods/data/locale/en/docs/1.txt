My dear envoy,

There is not much I can do for you from this distance, except to give you some advice. Who knows, maybe it will save your life one day.

First of all, you must always remember that the Allod of Yases belongs to the Kadagan Empire, which has been an enemy of Kania for a long time. Our home, Uimoir, doesn't belong to any of these empires, but it is well known that I sympathize with Great Mage Tenses, the keeper of a Kanian Allod. This is why you should refrain from mentioning my name. Generally, the fewer people that know about your Uimoir origin, the better. For that very same reason, and to protect your identity, I haven't given you any exceptional armor or magic scrolls so that you do not raise any suspicions.

I don't know much about the Allod of Yases. It is primarily an agricultural Allod, ruled by land aristocracy and the King. There are very few cities on this Allod. Most of the populations are peasants dwelling in small villages. Yases was saved from the Cataclysm by the recently deceased Great Mage Yokke. His successor Urd is not known among the Great Mages. He was considered Yokke's apprentice, but it is known that they didn't get along very well. There even were speculations that Yokke had actually banished his apprentice from the Allod. To this day, no one knows for sure who taught Urd to prevent the Astral from consuming the Allod.

None of my friends or acquaintances has a close connection with Yases, so I have no information as to what may await you there. You might find yourself in a safe and prosperous land, or there might be danger lurking behind every corner.

I am uncertain as to what is happening on Yases, which is the reason for sending you there. Try and find out what is happening on the Allod...and be careful.

Signed: Great Mage Skrakan of Uimoir, Rakhl-Uimoir Tower

P.S. Don't accuse me of carelessness. This letter is enchanted so that no one may read it except you.
