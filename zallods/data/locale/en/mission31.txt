The way here from Kaarg wasn't as long as I expected. I hope that finding the blacksmith won't take much time as well.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
The trip from Kaarg wasn't very long. The merchant must be the laziest guy on the Allod to mind such a trip. I wish we didn't have to work for such people!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
The distance between Kaarg and this place is not considerable. I wonder why the merchant did not investigate the issue himself? Anyway, that is none of my business.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
This place is really close to Kaarg! This merchant must be a pretty lazy type if he prefers to hire someone to go here instead of doing it himself. At least I didn't waste much time traveling here.

<npc=21, part=1>
Greetings, my good man. I am looking for Galen the blacksmith. Do you know where to find him? 
<npc=2112, part=2>
Yes, Galen is a well-known professional. He lives by himself. I believe the blacksmith is located to the north of this town.

Hello! Are you Galen the blacksmith? 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Hello! Are you Galen the blacksmith?

Hello! Are you Galen the blacksmith? 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Hello! Are you Galen the blacksmith? 
<npc=2017, part=2>
Yes.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
A merchant from Kaarg sent me to find out why you've stopped bringing swords to sell in Kaarg. What's the problem?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
I want to know why you've stopped bringing swords to sell in Kaarg. What's your problem? 
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
A merchant from Kaarg has sent me to ascertain why you are no longer selling your wares in Kaarg. Might I inquire if there is a problem?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
I'd like to know why you stopped bringing your swords into Kaarg. Is there anything wrong?
<npc=2017, part=4>
Nothing...wrong.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=5>
Look, you sound strange! Are you sick? 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=5>
You don't look all right! Are you sick? 
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=5>
You do not seem to alright to me. Perhaps, you are in need of medical treatment?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=5>
Look, normal people don't talk that way. I can cure you if you are sick.
<npc=2017, part=6>
I am healthy...I work...I do everything well...I feel fine.
<npc=21, part=7>
Something's definitely wrong with him. I should look for someone else to explain what's going on here.

Are you Galen the blacksmith? 
<npc=2017, part=2>
Yes.
<npc=22, part=3>
Then tell me why you've stopped supplying swords to Kaarg? Is something wrong?
<npc=2017, part=4>
Nothing.
<npc=22, part=5>
Look, blacksmith, you sound strange! Are you sick?

Good day, farmer! 
<npc=2108, part=2>
I am not a farmer! I am Galen's apprentice!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
Great! You're the one I need to talk to. Tell me, what's happened to Galen? He talks strange, and there's something weird about his looks.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
Perfect! You can help me then. Tell me what's happened to Galen? He's acting strangely!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
This is great news! Please tell me, what has happened to Galen? There is something artificial about the way he looks and talks!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
Better yet. Then answer a simple question. What's wrong with Galen?
<npc=2108, iammale, part=4>
I don't know, sir...
<npc=2108, iamfemale, part=4>
I don't know, lady...
<npc=21, part=5>
Why are you so scared? You know something but you're afraid to tell me, aren't you? If you tell me, I may be able to help your master!
<npc=2108, part=6>
The Necromancers visited us and placed a curse on my master. Now, he doesn't recognize anyone and doesn't talk at all. He just works day and night at his smithy.
<npc=2108, part=7>
I have heard that such curses can be removed by killing the mage who created it, but how can I possibly confront the power of the Necromancers?
<npc=21, part=8>
Where are these Necromancers right now?
<npc=2108, part=9>
They're in a village in the east. They're also holding some hostages from our village! Please try and help them!

I am looking for someone who could tell me about the blacksmith. 
<npc=2108, part=2>
I am his apprentice, good sir. What would you like to know?
<npc=22, part=3>
Then you must know why there is something strange about the way Galen looks and talks. What's wrong with him?
<npc=2108, part=4>
I don't know, sir...
<npc=22, part=5>
Why are you so scared? You know something but you're afraid to tell, aren't you? Tell me and I shall help your master!

<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=1>
Well, I guess these are the hostages. Hang on guys...I'll get you out of here.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Judging by the screaming people behind this fence, these must be the hostages. Well, they'll soon be released.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
These people behind the fence are most likely the hostages from the village. I shall endeavor to free you from your captivity now.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
These must be the hostages. Having a bad day are you? Well, your suffering is almost over! 
<npc=2108, part=2>
HELP! Rescue us! Please! I'll ask the headman to pay you if you get us out of here!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
Oh, you don't have to say that. I'll get you out of here with or without a reward.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
Shut up and keep quiet while I'm getting you out! We'll discuss the terms later.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
I have never rejected money. But we shall discuss this later when you are free!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
Now that's pleasant! But let me get you out of here first. We'll talk about a reward later.

Hang on to your gratitude until you are free!

Thank you so much! Being cursed is about as bad as it gets. You can understand everything going on around you, but you can't say or do anything about it.
<npc=2018, part=2>
The hands work fine, but the next minute you're handing over all of your possessions to a complete stranger! That's the way I lost all the swords I made.
<npc=2018, part=3>
I just turned over the last one just a moment ago...You can still catch up with this bastard and get the sword back, if you hurry. There's just one road out of this place!
