<npc=22, part=1>
You know, Dina, I'm starting to believe your grandpa was right. Nobody has tried to assail us yet, and those illustrious Druids keep hiding.
<npc=22, part=2>
What worries me is that we've turned right and left quite a few times. Were we supposed to do that? I think we're lost...
<npc=23, part=3>
Please forgive me, oh please...I don't know where to go now! The notes show where the Star has fallen, but it's so easy to lose your way in the Ancient Woods! I'm the one to blame...
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
It's ok, these woods aren't as crowded as the city marketplace, but they can be just as confusing. I guess the good thing is that no one's going to try and steal our moneybag in the woods!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
You're not gonna start crying now, are you? Come on, cheer up buttercup! We've seen shrubbery before you know!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
You should not be downhearted. I would admit that the situation is unpleasant, but it is not any more serious than that.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part4=>
You still have a lot to learn, darling. Like keeping yourself together when life gets tough. 
<npc=22, part=5>
We have to move on. If we continue to stay here, we're not going to find neither the star, nor the way out of here!

It's not often that Plain dwellers wander into the Ancient Woods. What are you looking for?
<npc=21, part=2>
Frankly, we're looking for a path right now. However, we have an important business here which is not a matter to be discussed with strangers.
<npc=21, iammale, part=3>
I've heard that the Druids are the real masters of the Ancient Woods. I would be willing to convey this business to them.

<npc=2134, part=4>
I wouldn't count on that. All Druids including Great Saken-Maye, their chief, are very reserved, and they dislike strangers. Your best bet is to leave the Woods as quickly as you can. 
<npc=21, iammale, part=5>
I would like to try anyway...I hope he agrees to listen.

<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=1>
Now this is the place never visited by prosperity! I wonder if the Druids dislike humans so much as to make them abandon their own homes?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Quite a village we've got here! The locals must be lazy, or someone banished them from their home. I wonder if the Druids may have kicked them out?
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
These dwellings are badly maintained. It's possible that the Druids determined that the peasants were abusing the land and then forced them to leave.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Oh Great Spheres, what kind of place is this? The filth and misery of a forsaken land! I wonder if the Druids are responsible? I wouldn't put it past them to do something like this! 
<npc=2133, iammale, part=2>
Be careful when you speak, stranger! Don't say such words about the masters of the Ancient Woods unless you plan to challenge them or us.

<npc=2133, part=3>
We are hunters rather than peons. We do not have to cut trees for farming as the Woods give us our food. And most importantly, we have our freedom!
<npc=2133, part=4>
When the royal tax collectors come to our village, they only see empty houses, and there's nothing they can do but leave. It's easier to get along with the Druids than with the royal authority!

Leave! People from the Plains are not welcome here!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
My, you're a tough one. All I want is to talk to one of you.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Take it easy, sis! All I want is talk to one of you guys, and then I'll gladly leave.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
Would you please control your temper? We only request a short conversation with one of your kind.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
I have serious business to convey to you, which is the only reason for me to be here in the first place. However, your suggestion seems very tempting.
<npc=683, part=3>
We have more important duties than talking to strangers. The zombies have suddenly invaded the country between the two rivers. We have an order from Great Saken-Maye to prevent their spreading.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
That's an honorable mission! The dead shouldn't be among the living, so I'd be willing to help you put them back into the ground.
<npc=683, iammale, iamfighter, part=5>
It's not going to be as easy as you may think, warrior!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
Oh really? Would you mind if I helped you kick some zombie butt?
<npc=683, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=5>
You are a confident lady, aren't you? Kicking doesn't do much harm to a zombie, you know.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
This is a grave situation. I would be willing to provide assistance should you request so.
<npc=683, iammale, iammage, part=5>
It's graver than you think, mage!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=4>
You're just going to "prevent them from spreading"? Is that all you can do? The zombies must be eliminated, and I can help you to do this.
<npc=683, iamfemale, iammage, part=5>
You speak as if you have already won. Don't underestimate their force!
<npc=683, part=6>
However, should your compassion guide you to support our cause, we would accept your offer. A company under the command of wise Arafel-Faye is holding the zombies between the rivers right now.

#event14
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=1>
That sure wasn't easy. Those damned zombies attacked so desperately, it's as if someone was driving them on...
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Phew! Finally defeated that rotten army! What was the dead doing here anyway? It's like someone was instigating them!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
I have a suspicion that the army of zombies had a reason to advance so fiercely. Perhaps, someone was directing their actions.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Looks like I just got here in time! The zombies must have had a reason to attack so vigorously. Someone must have been directing them!
<npc=680, part=2>
Each pack has a leader, and this army of the walking dead had a commander. Nevertheless, our men are exhausted now, and we can not take the risk of searching for him!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
I wouldn't mind finding the commander. I'd love to explain to the commander how "dead" wrong he his, if you get my meaning!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
It's damn clear there's a commander! Do whatever you wish, I'm going to find this commander myself!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
I should offer my services then. I am interested in finding this person, from both theoretical and practical points of view.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
Well, I'm going to go and find out who is responsible for this outrage.

Don't delude yourself, noble stranger. The evil dead couldn't have coordinated themselves so well. Someone had to have been directing them. Unfortunately, we can't start searching now. We're just too exhausted.

I was glad to assist you, no matter how small my contribution was. However, it seems to me that we have not defeated all of the enemies yet. Someone must have been directing the zombies in that battle.
<npc=680, part=2>
You are correct, young lady. Nevertheless, our men are exhausted, and we can not find and destroy him until we have recovered.
<npc=23, part=3>
Would you allow me to do it, then? The zombies were certainly controlled by one of the Necromancers, and I have a good reason to hate them!
<npc=680, part=4>
You are still young and inexperienced...Will you be able to manage this task?
<npc=23, part=5>
Probably not if I go all by myself. But I have friends to help me!

Don't thank me! It was a pleasure to eradicate those rotten troopers and their Necromancer bosses. I hope those boss guys don't become zombies themselves!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
Oh, you should not thank me so much. The important thing is that the zombies are destroyed and their Necromancer commanders are dead as well.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
Sure thing! You would have had trouble beating both the zombies and their Necromancer boss. Fortunately, I got here just in time.
<npc=21, part=3>
Frankly, I'd be happy if this news never left the Woods. The King favors the Necromancer Guild, and this is not our first encounter with them.
<npc=21, part=4>
We've had some small conflicts with them so far which were, thankfully, left unnoticed.  However, if the Guild investigates the circumstances of today's battle, we're in deep trouble.
<npc=680, part=5>
You needn't worry about it. Not even the smallest grass blade will tell of this battle today. The Woods will keep your secret for as long as needed.
<npc=680, part=6>
From now on, you and your friends are welcome in the Ancient Woods. I, Arafel-Faye, invite you to a place rarely visited by Plain dwellers. There we can sit down and discuss everything in peace.

As a matter of fact, there would be trouble for us if someone in Kaarg learns about this. The King favors the Necromancer Guild, and this is not my first encounter with them.
<npc=22, part=5>
So far my actions could have been qualified as protection of my honor and my land. However, today I deliberately attacked the Necromancers without being provoked.
