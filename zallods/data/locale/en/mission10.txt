Great Mage Skrakan

You must get to Rakhl-Uimoir tower and talk to Great Mage Skrakan.
#
===hero dies
#failure2
Few people can endure the way to Rakhl-Uimoir!
#
===skrakan attacked
#failure5
Your hero has annoyed Skrakan himself! His death was swift...
#
=======Hero thinks before leaving======
#event1
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
I was told that Great Mage Skrakan enjoys his privacy. I guess it's true. It's getting more and more deserted as I get closer to his tower.
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
Looks like Skrakan's tower is nearby. I hope I don't lose my way. Nobody's around to show me the path home.
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
It's known that Great Mage Skrakan enjoys his privacy. It looks like nobody's around to show me the path. I'll have to find the way on my own.
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
Skrakan's tower should be nearby, but I'm so bored with traveling! And nobody's around to give directions either...
#
======The hero meets chief troll (level 4) who doesn't fight himself, but sends a young troll instead.=======
#event2
<npc=623, part=1>
Humph! Me Hydun the Second now fight not want. Your there go, young troll see. Fight you he will. Bet you I want!
<npc=623, part=2>
Your, humph, fight, me here wait. Your win, seven hunder coins give your I will. Your lose, kill you I will, money yer take.
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=3>
Seven hundred coins is good money. But a troll, even a young one, is a hell of a fight. What if I don't take the bet?
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=3>
Seven hundred coins is quite a bit of money. But a troll, even a young one, is quite an opponent. Tell me, Hydun the Second, what if I don't take the bet?
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=3>
That's an interesting offer, but the risk is grave. Tell me, o mighty Hydun, what happens if I prefer not to accept the bet?
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=3>
What if I don't want to bet? And don't think I'm afraid, I might have some other business to attend to.
<npc=623, part=4>
Me not, humph, care. Your want not, force you not I will. But if bet your, humph, take, me promise I keep, back your not go!
#
======The hero passes the canyon, and the 4th troll becomes hostile =====
#event9
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
It might have been a mistake to accept that bet...But there's no going back. Hydun the Second won't let me pass unless I win.
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
So where's this stupid troll? If I don't find it and kill it, I'm in deep trouble with Hydun the Second!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
I'm starting to regret this bet. But it's too late to turn around, Hydun the Second won't let me pass unless I win the bet.
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
Seems like it's getting colder...Do I actually need these seven hundred coins? Maybe I should go back?
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=2>
I guess it's too late now. Hydun the Second won't let me pass until I slay the other troll.
#
======The hero kills the young troll.=====
#event10
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
Wow! What a chore! I'll need to catch my breath now.
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
That's it for taking bets! I should be more cautious next time.
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
Gasp! Seven hundred coins aren't worth this much pain!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
I should acknowledge that this walking mountain of crap could have killed me with a single blow. Good that I didn't let it hit me!
#
===talking to troll
#event3
<npc=623, part=1>
Humph, no good those youngsters are.  When young I was...
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=2>
Yeah, yeah, very interesting and all. I'll be sure to listen to your story next time, but I've got to go now. Farewell, Hydun the Second!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=2>
Aww, don't say that. You still look so strong...So strong that I'd better go now. Farewell, Hydun the Second!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=2>
I will be honored to hear your tale next time, but I must hurry now. Farewell, Hydun the Second!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=2>
Yeah, right. In the good old times trolls were stronger, mountains higher, grass greener. Blah, blah, blah. Bye now, Hydun the Second!
#
=======Meeting an old ogre=========
#event4
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
What is that? Am I going to become an ogre's dinner today?
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
What is that? An ogre? Oh, damn!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
Of all the races I know, ogres are one of the most troublesome. And it looks like my trouble is starting right now...
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
Looks like there's an ogre. What an unpleasant creature!
<npc=616, part=2>
Who is it? What do you want from an oldster? My arms are weak, my teeth are rotten. I can't even rip the flesh from the bone and feed myself anymore. Leave me alone!
#
=======Meeting the old ogre once again=====
#event5
<npc=616, part=1>
You again? No quiet for an old ogre. Why do you have to annoy me? I guess I'll have to remember the good old times. Where is my club, anyway?!
#
======ogre killed======
#event6
<npc=21, part=1>
"Oldster," he said! He seemed young enough when he swung that club at me!
#
======Approaching Skrakan's tower, a dragon flies by=======
#event7
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
I'm dead! I can't possibly fight a Dragon! 
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=1>
Goodbye, world! The Dragon's too tough for me!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
A Dragon! I can't do anything against that!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=1>
Damn! I can't possibly win a fight with a Dragon!
<npc=651, iammale, part=2>
That is correct, human. If you were ten times stronger than you are, you still could not harm me.
<npc=651, iamfemale, part=2>
That is correct, woman. If you were ten times stronger than you are, you still could not harm me. 
<npc=651, iammale, part=3>
But I am not going to attack you. I serve Great Mage Skrakan, who knows you are here. You may pass.
<npc=651, iamfemale, part=3>
But I am not going to attack you. I serve Great Mage Skrakan, who knows you are here. You may pass.
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=4>
Oh, thank the maker! I thought I was dead for sure!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=4>
I...I think I wet myself...
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=4>
Phew! I thought I was going to become your snack or something!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=4>
Today must be my lucky day! I thought I was dead!
#
========After all challenges the hero meets Skrakan at the entrance to the tower========
#event8
<npc=2000, part=1>
I welcome the one who dared to accept my challenge, and passed.
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=2>
Thank you, Great Mage Skrakan. Frankly, I never thought I'd meet a Great Mage.
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=2>
Greetings, Great Mage. Excuse me if this is too short, but I'm not good at flattery.
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=2>
It's a pleasure to meet you, Great Mage Skrakan. I am willing to hear all you have to say.
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=2>
I appreciate your cordiality, Skrakan, and I am delighted to meet you. It is not common to meet a Great Mage!
<npc=2000, part=3>
We don't have much time, so I'll get straight to the point. As a native of Uimoir, you must be familiar with the story of the Demon from the Outer World, whom I carelessly summoned one hundred years ago.
<npc=21, part=4 >
Of course! I heard stories when I was a child...
<npc=2000, iammale, part=5>
I am impressed with your education, but please, try not to interrupt me again. As you might have noticed on the way to my tower, the Demon's creatures are still ravaging Uimoir to this day.
<npc=2000, iamfemale, part=5>
I am impressed with your education, but please, try not to interrupt me again. As you might have noticed on the way to my tower, the Demon's creatures are still ravaging Uimoir to this day.
<npc=2000, part=6>
Recently, I have found that magic similar to the one exercised by the Demon is being used on the Allod of Yases.
<npc=21, part=7>
This can't be! Another creature from the Outside? Yokke is the Great Mage of Yases, right? Why didn't he do something about it?
<npc=2000, part=8>
It seems that the schools are giving obsolete knowledge nowadays. Yokke died and his apprentice, Urd, has become the Keeper of Yases. It happened almost immediately after the Demon was defeated...
<npc=2000, part=9>
Urd is young and inexperienced for a Great Mage. Personally, I am not afraid of the creatures from the Outside. What I do fear is that he or someone else has decided to play with this dangerous magic.
<npc=21, iammale, part=10>
So, what shall I do?
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=10>
So, what shall I do?
<npc=2000, part=11>
Find out what is going on there, and stop it if you can. Your reward will be generous, I promise.
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=12>
Sounds complicated...ok, I'll go to Yases and find out what's going on, then I'll do my best to put a stop to any evil I find!
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMFIGHTER, PART=12 >
Perfect! Whoever is using that magic has asked for it! Thank you, Great Skrakan. I'll prove to you that you chose your emissary right!
<NPC=21, IAMMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=12 >
A Great Mage's word is worth much. And the quest is equally impressive. I will do what I can to protect the Allod against any evil I find.
<NPC=21, IAMFEMALE, IAMMAGE, PART=12 >
Wonderful! This mission is the right one for me. Thank you, Great Skrakan, I will accomplish your task and prove that I am worthy of your trust!
