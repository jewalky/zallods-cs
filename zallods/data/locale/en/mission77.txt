#event1
<npc=21, part=1>
Looks like an exceptionally gloomy place! No one in his right mind, except for Necromancers, would agree to live here.
<npc=23, part=2>
You're only disgusted, but I'm scared to death! I start remembering that terrible day when they took me away from our house and started interrogating me...
<npc=22, part=3>
Compose yourself, Dina, please. I'm not happy about seeking help from the Necromancers, either.
<npc=22, part=4>
But I don't see any other way.

<npc=825, part=1>
Who are you? What do you want here?
<npc=21, part=2>
I'm going to the cemetery where...a friend of mine is buried.
<npc=825, part=3>
Is that so? Common people can not go there, whoever they are!
<npc=21, part=4>
What would you do? Force me to leave?
<npc=825, part=5>
There's no need to. The cemetery is well guarded. The guards have been doing their job just fine so far, and I see no reason for them to fail this time.

<npc=825, part=1>
Who are you, Knight? What do you want here, so far away from Kaarg? 
<npc=22, part=2>
My ancestry gives me the right to do what I please, where I please. Now, for instance, I want to visit your cemetery.
<npc=825, part=3>
Is that so? Common people can not go there, whoever they are!
<npc=22, part=4>
What are you gonna do? Force me to leave?

<npc=825, part=1>
Who are you, maid? What do you want here?
<npc=23, part=2>
I must visit the cemetery. I...My...I was asked to see if everything is all right with one of the graves.
<npc=825, part=3>
Is that so? Common people can not go there, whoever they are!
<npc=23, part=4>
Will you force me to leave?
<npc=825, part=5>

<npc=835, part=1>
Hey, wait a second...I think I know you! You and a Knight named Igles have fought with members of our Guild quite a number of times!
<npc=21, part=2>
I can't deny those incidents. I also wouldn't mind participating in another fight, if you wish to start one. Those fights so far have NOT been routinely ending to your advantage.
<npc=835, part=3>
I am not going to fight you, because I believe that you and Igles are absolutely right. The Necromancers on Yases are not what they used to be.
<npc=835, part=4>
As a member of the Guild, I know the orders Urd is now giving, and by what means those orders are followed...You would be horrified if I told you!
<npc=835, part=5>
My oath does not let me tell you much, but I would like to help you in some other way. 
<npc=21, part=6>
I must talk to the spirit of a Necromancer who participated in an expedition to the Source of Magic. I must get to the cemetery to do it though...
<npc=835, part=7>
This is impossible! The cemetery is very well guarded, and the guards would not let you in. They won't even let me in!
<npc=835, part=8>
The only chance is to use the invisibility spell. Fortunately, I know it. You don't have to go there, that would be an unnecessary risk.

<npc=835, part=1>
Hey, wait a second...I think I know you! You're Igles, the Knight who's fought with members of our Guild quite a number of times!
<npc=22, part=2>
You're right...What do you want? Another fight? You're welcome to one!

<npc=835, part=1>
Hey, wait a second, lass...I think I know you! You and a Knight named Igles have fought with members of our Guild quite a number of times!
<npc=23, part=2>
Yes, you're right and I'm proud of it! Perhaps, you would like to avenge the destruction of your guildsmen? If so, I am ready for your attack!
<npc=835, part=3>
I am not going to fight you because I believe that you and Igles are absolutely right.  The Necromancers on Yases are not what they used to be.

======Good necromancer tries to summon the spirit
#event8
<npc=835, part=1>
I can not summon the spirit from this grave! I do not have enough power for this spell...I need help! 
<npc=835, part=2>
I must go to the Southern Dwellings. A colleague of mine named Kaasis lives there. He also considers the current Guild politics corrupt.
<npc=835, part=3>
I think he won't mind helping Urd's enemies!
#
======Good necromancer talks to his friend
#event9
<npc=835, part=1>
Kaasis, can you hear me? I want to ask you for a favor, old friend. Have you heard about Sir Igles, who's been challenging the power of our Guild?
<npc=836, part=2>
Yes I have. I believe that since the Guild is unable to resist Urd's orders, someone should try and stop Urd and free the Guild from his control.
<npc=835, part=3>
Well, Igles and his friends are here now. They need to summon a spirit from its grave and talk to it. I don't have enough power to do it alone.
<npc=836, part=4>
I see...All right, I'll help you to summon this sprit.
#
======Good necromancer and his friend try to summon the spirit.
#event10
<npc=835, part=1>
Even the two of us can not do it!
<npc=836, part=2>
I feel someone coming this way...We must leave!
<npc=835, part=3>
No, this is our chance! I will cover us with invisibility, and we'll be able to see what happens here.
#
======Good necromancer saw everything
#event11
<npc=835, part=1>
Now I understand what has to be done! I can't summon the spirit, but there's no need to do it! It turns out that we can talk to the spirit while he's still in the grave.
#
======Good necromancer saw nothing
#event12
<npc=835, part=1>
I couldn't see anything, but something very important was going on at the cemetery...
<npc=835, part=2>
Unfortunately, all our efforts were futile. Neither I, nor anybody else will be able to help Igles and his friends!
#
======Good necromancer talks to the spirit
#event13
<npc=835, part=1>
O great spirit of our distinguished brother!
<npc=835, part=2>
Tell us where the Source of Magic is located.
<npc=835, part=3>
Yes...Yes, I know this lake...I have learned all I need. Rest in peace now.
<npc=835, part=4>
Well. I only have to tell this to Igles or his friends now.
#
======Good necromancer talks to hero
#event14
<npc=835, part=1>
I have learned everything. The Source of Magic is located on an island in the Dragon Lake. The lake is on the border of the Orcish lands. But the Source is enchanted!
<npc=835, part=2>
No one can remove the spell. The secret formula is hidden amongst one of the ancient legends, but there are thousands of legends in our libraries...
<npc=21, part=3>
Maybe I could find the right one! Where is this library?
<npc=835, part=4>
Not far from here, but keep in mind that although it is less protected than our cemetery, someone from the street won't have a very good chance of getting inside!
<npc=21, part=5>
Goodbye then! I want you to know...I never thought that I would ever be grateful to a Necromancer, but I thank you from the bottom of my heart!
