This Druid scientist must have hit his head falling from his oak tree, or whatever he lived on, when he was a child. It's the only reason I can imagine for living in the desert among the orcs.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Let the earth swallow the sands, and all their inhabitants! This scientist must be brain damaged to live here at his own will!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
I certainly respect the scientific enthusiasm of my colleague. Yet purposely living in the sands with the orcs as neighbors...This is not devotion, this is derangement!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
I don't understand this scientist. If someone wants to study orcs, they can catch a couple, put them in a cage and work in comfort. But this one has to live in the desert!
<npc=23, iammale, part=2>
You are wrong! A man willing to endure hardship and discomfort for the sake of knowledge deserves respect rather than sneers.

Dina is right. Besides, nobody forced us to come here. We all agreed to do it. Even if the old man is mad as a hatter, I'm going to keep my word!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
I'm not saying anything. We'll do what we promised. But the place is still nasty.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
I'm not backing off. We'll do what we promised. It doesn't make the sands nicer though!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
I am not arguing against fulfilling our promise. However, I am not going to enjoy it either.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=4>
We'll do what we promised. But that still won't make the wind cool or the orcs smell nice!

<npc=2108, part=1>
Frankly, I thought that no one would come. People tend to dislike traveling in orcish sands...
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
You're right, good man. I don't like it here as well...Anyway, I wanted to talk to your master, not to you. What is his need?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
You're absolutely right! I don't like it here at all...Anyway, I need to talk to your master. What does he want?
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
That is a correct statement. I do not enjoy being here as well. However, I would like to talk to your master. What does he want us to do?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
You're pretty observant, good man! Traveling here isn't something I would call a pleasure.  But let's get down to business. What does your master want?
<npc=2005, part=3>
As you know, I study the life of the Orcs, but I also do a lot of experiments. I need the juice of a giant cactus for one of them.
<npc=2005, part=4>
I can't obtain it because I don't know where this sort of cactus grows, but I do know that the Orcish shamans use it in their rituals.
<npc=2005, part=5>
Whoever brings me the juice will be generously rewarded!

It is indeed unpleasant here...But shall we talk about business instead? What does your master need? Maybe he can tell us?

<npc=2005, part=1>
It is nice to know that there are people who treat my words seriously! I thought everyone considers me a mad scientist...a loon. 
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
Come on, no one has ever thought anything like that! Why don't we talk about something else? Look what I have for you. 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Well, frankly, I had a faint impression...Why don't we talk about something else? Take a look at the thing I have for you. 
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
Uh...No, you are all right. Well, almost all right...As a matter of fact, I was going to show you something.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
Well, maybe there's someone who doesn't think so...anything's possible. Anyway, I was going to show you something. What do you think?
<npc=2005, part=3>
This...This is it! The juice of the giant cactus is finally in my grasp! I will shower you with gold...In reasonable amounts, of course. I am a loon all right, but that doesn't make me stupid.

Those who say so are idiots themselves. I don't listen to them. Here, look at what I have for you...

This looks like the foul liquid that the Orcish shamans drink before their rituals...We should show this flask to a knowledgeable man!
