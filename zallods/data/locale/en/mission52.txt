<npc=21, part=1>
Look! It seems that the Druids are not the only inhabitants of this forest! There's a regular village in front of us.
<npc=22, part=2>
There is something strange about it though. I bet that the locals have long forgotten about paying taxes to their Lord.
<npc=21, part=3>
I hope you are not going to remind them, are you?
<npc=22, part=4>
No, although I should. But this land is not mine, so it's none of my business to tell the locals what to do.

#event2
<npc=21, part=1>
Greetings, good man! We are looking for the Druids. Could you tell us where to find them?
<npc=2112, part=2>
The Druids are our neighbors. Go further into the Forest, by the Waterfall, to meet them. 
<npc=2112, part=3>
But be careful. The Waterfall is a special place, and the Druids are picky about visitors.  The Bridge Keepers are vigilant! 
<npc=21, part=4>
Thanks for the warning. We shall try not to upset those...What did you call them? Bridge Keepers, right?

Who are you and what do you seek in the Forest. You would be better off turning back if it's not important!
<npc=21, part=2>
I have an obligation to find the hermit Druid who came here from the Land Between Rivers. 
<npc=687, part=3>
Well, we might be able to help you. But the decision is to be made by Samoin-Maye, the chief Druid of the Forest. The Bridge Keepers might not let you see him...
<npc=687, part=4>
I shall test you. Clear the riverbank of all the monster bees. By doing so you will prove your worthiness of learning the secret sign. This will allow the Bridge Keepers to let you pass.

My friend has an obligation to find the hermit Druid who came here from the Land Between Rivers. My friend's word is also my own, so we are searching together.

Halt! Whoever you are, you shall not pass if you do not know the secret sign!

Halt! This way opens only at Samoyn-Maye's order!

Samoyn-Maye gave his permission. I shall allow you to pass.

I was informed that you were looking for a hermit Druid from the Land Between Rivers. I remember him, he was going to settle on an island by the waterfall.
<npc=690, part=2>
None of us has ever seen him since, as this island is sacred for the Druids of the Forest. It is forbidden for any of us to go there.
<npc=21, iammale, part=3>
Could something have happened to him? I humbly request your permission to visit the island and check on him. I hope this wouldn't defile the island.
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=3>
Didn't it occur to you that something has happened to him? Maybe I could visit the place and see what's going on. You have my word that I won't defile the island.
<npc=690, part=4>
This is a complicated issue. It was established that a human not bound with the taboo might visit our sacred place given that he or she has performed a noble task. 
<npc=690, iammale, part=5>
You certainly fit the taboo part, but I have no way of knowing that you have indeed done something decent.
<npc=690, iamfemale, part=5>
You certainly fit the taboo part, but I have no way of knowing that you have indeed done something decent.
<npc=21, part=6>
Well then, why don't you give me a task that would confirm my integrity?
<npc=690, part=7>
All right. There are bats dwelling in the ruins up above the waterfall. These critters don't obey us and literally plague the neighborhood. You must destroy them!

I already know that you have completed the task I gave you. I shall keep my promise and let you visit the island!

So much for searching! The hermit will never see the Land Between Rivers again...

The bees will bother us no more. Thank you. Behold now the secret sign! This will allow you to pass the guard at the bridge.
#
=======guard 1 ok
#event20
<npc=688, part=1>
I see the secret sign! The bridge is open for the one that knows it!
