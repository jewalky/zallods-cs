<npc=21, part=1>
I'm looking for the keeper of the library. I was told that...
<npc=697, part=2>
Yes, I am the keeper! Did you bring me a manuscript? I would be happy to add it to my collection!
<npc=21, part=3>
To your collection? I thought new manuscripts were supposed to be added to the library? I'm afraid that I don't have a manuscript with me today. Maybe the next time I visit...
<npc=21, part=4>
I'm collecting legends about the fabled, Raminan Island, and I would like to ask for your help. Not without compensation, of course.
<npc=697, part=5>
Don't try to bribe me! This is the Guild's special library. You have to be initiated to use it. Look for your tales in Kaarg! Now, be-gone!

Halt! I must know what brings you here. Answer quickly and honestly.
<npc=700, part=2>
Be assured that I can detect any lie. And if I do, a serious interrogation will follow!
<npc=21, part=3>
I've always considered honesty to be the best policy. I came here to see the library keeper. He is expecting a new manuscript, but I told him that I don't have one.
<npc=700, part=3>
Well...Well...Yes, your words are true, so I shall not delay you any more. I shall even give you some advice: stay away from the library.
<npc=700, part=4>
An extremely rare book, the third volume of the "Necronomicon", was stolen. You'll be in trouble if you're mistaken for the thief!
<npc=21, part=5>
Thank you! I guess I should stop by the keeper's house rather than by the library to say goodbye to him. Where does he live, by the way?
<npc=700, part=4>
His house is down the eastbound road.

======Hero breaks into librarian's house.
#event8
<npc=21, part=1>
A lock on the door...A rather strange one too! It took just a couple of accidental hits with some fire arrow to break it!
<npc=21, part=2>
Wow! This is a lucky visit! The "Necronomicon", volume three, right on the table!
<npc=21, part=3>
The keeper said that he doesn't take bribes. Perhaps we should see if blackmail works better!
#
======Igles breaks into librarian's house.
#event9
<npc=22, part=1>
A lock on the door...A cheap one, I think. It breaks in pieces from just one accidental blow with my ax!

Wow! This is a lucky visit! The "Necronomicon", volume three, right on the table!

Ouch! The lock has fallen apart...I only had to accidental hit it three times with my stone arrows!

#event11
<npc=21, part=1>
Greetings, good man. How is your health? How are you doing? How is the theft investigation going? Perhaps, you need some help with it?
<npc=21, part=2>
Especially considering that I know exactly where the stolen book is. A nice house of a wealthy man...Do you understand what I mean?
<npc=697, part=3>
What are you talking about? What house? I...I'm calling the guards! 
<npc=21, part=4>
Sure, call them. It's a good time to arrest the owner of the house where the "Necronomicon" is. You know him well, don't you? 
<npc=21, part=5>
However, if you let me see the collection of legends that I mentioned last time, I'd be willing to forget what I saw in that wealthy house.
<npc=697, part=6>
Don't, don't say any more! I've just realized that there's nothing secret about the tales about Raminan island. Here, this is the scroll you need.
<npc=21, part=7>
Weeell...Let's just see here...
<npc=22, part=8>
The poison stings, 
The mortal dies.
The one who passes,
Gets the prize 
<npc=21, part=9>
This is what I need! Thanks a lot, you thief...You're of no interest to me anymore.

#event12
<npc=22, part=1>
Listen, keeper! I have just broken into your house...Yes, I know this is illegal. But I have found what I expected to find.
<npc=22, part=2>
Now you have a choice between being arrested or fulfilling my request. I need the collection of legends about the Raminan Island. You have five seconds to decide.
<npc=22, part=3>
One... Two... Three... Four...
<npc=697, part=4>
Don't, don't say any more! I've just realized that there's nothing secret about the tales about Raminan island. Here, this is the scroll you need.
<npc=22, part=5>
It's good that you realize things. Give me the book! Weeell...Let's just see here...
<npc=22, part=6>
The poison stings, 
The mortal dies.
The one who passes,
Gets the prize 
<npc=22, part=7>
This is what I need! Thanks a lot, you thief...You're of no interest to me anymore.

#event13
<npc=23, part=1>
Are you still here? I have unpleasant news for you. I just broke into your house...
<npc=697, part=2>
What?! You thief! I'm calling the guards!
<npc=23, part=3>
Go ahead, call them. They would arrest you as well after I tell them that the stolen book is in your home!
<npc=697, part=4>
Shut up! Someone may hear us! What do you want?
<npc=23, part=5>
Same as before. I need the collection of legends about Raminan Island.
<npc=697, part=6>
That's all? Take it, take it away with you, and don't come back, I beg you...
<npc=23, part=7>
Weeell...Let's just see here...
<npc=23, part=8>
The poison stings, 
The mortal dies.

So this is the house of a humble librarian? Well, well...His private collection must also be worth looking at.
