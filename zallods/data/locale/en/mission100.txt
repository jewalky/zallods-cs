If I were a King, I wouldn't come here for all the gold in Yases. How can anyone enjoy hunting in such a gloomy place?
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=1>
One thing's for sure, I wouldn't call this landscape beautiful. How can anyone enjoy hunting in such a gloomy place?
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=1>
It is hard to imagine that this landscape can amuse anyone. It is even harder to imagine someone enjoying hunting in such a place.
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=1>
If I were a King, I'd hang the one who suggested hunting in such a gloomy place. How can anyone enjoy this?
<npc=23, part=2>
Squirrel hunters sometimes visited us when I lived with my grandpa. They were always tired, hungry and often wounded.
<npc=23, part=3>
For them, hunting was a hard job. They said that they couldn't understand how the Lords can do it just for fun.
<npc=22, part=4>
Oh, they can. Trust me. The King comes here to hunt for something other than squirrels though. His huntsmen breed especially dangerous game that can rip us to shreds if we're not careful.
<npc=22, part=5>
Enough talk. We have to hurry if we want to make it to the King's cabin. Let's go!

Who are you and how did you get all the way out here? The local beasts know me, but I'm still hesitant to leave my cabin without arming myself. Those who wander here by accident tend to die here!
<npc=2008, iamfemale, part=1>

<npc=21, iamfighter, iammale, part=2>
Well, more bones were left to rot in this soil today, but they weren't human!. To put it simply, we fought our way through.
<npc=21, iamfighter, iammale, part=3>
I hope you don't love your creatures so dearly as to take that as an insult?
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=2>
A troll isn't as horrible as the stories make them out to be, good man! We had no trouble with the beasties coming here, if you know what I mean.
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=3>
I hope you don't love your creatures so dearly as to take that as an insult?
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=2>
Well, it was an unlucky day for the beasts, good man. As a matter of fact, they're not much fiercer than their wild cousins in my opinion.
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=3>
I hope you don't love your creatures so dearly as to take that as an insult?
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=2>
Listen, good man, I've about had enough of these beasts. Those turtles of yours have already upset me to no end...I don't need any more anger today, my friend.
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=3>
I hope you don't love your creatures so dearly as to take that as an insult?
<npc=2008, part=4>
No, not at all! Frankly, I don't enjoy serving here, and I'm scared to death of my turtles, not to mention the bigger beasts out in the woods. The fewer of them, the better, I say.
<npc=21, part=5>
I can help you to get out of these cursed woods. Just tell me how to find the King's cabin and I'll be on my way.
<npc=2008, part=6>
There are two mountain passes you can use to find the King's cabin. One is in the North, and another one in the East. The eastern road is shorter, but it's also more dangerous. Many wild beasts dwell there.

How did you get way out here, good sir? The local beasts know me, but still I'm hesitant to leave my cabin without arming myself first. Those who wander here by accident tend to die here!
<npc=22, part=2>
I have my reasons to be here, good man. As for your beasts, I'm afraid they're nothing more than corpses now.
<npc=22, part=3>

How did you get way out here, lass? The local beasts know me, but still I'm hesitant to leave my cabin without arming myself. As for those who wander here by accident, usually only bones are left of them!
<npc=23, part=2>
This place is dangerous indeed, good sir. But it's possible to pass for one who doesn't mind leaving turtle bones behind. I hope you aren't angry that your favorite critters are dead now.
<npc=2008, part=3>
No, not at all! Frankly, I don't enjoy serving here, and I'm scared to death of my turtles, not to mention the bigger beasts out in the woods. The fewer of them, the better, I say.
<npc=23, part=4>
I can ask my friends to help you to get out of these cursed woods. Just tell me how to find the King's cabin and I'll be on my way.

Your majesty! In accordance with the ancient custom, I was chosen by the noble houses of Yases to ask you three questions on their behalf.
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=1>
Your majesty! In accordance with the ancient custom, I was chosen by the noble houses of Yases to ask you three questions on their behalf.
<npc=21, part=2>
First question. Are you indeed the King to whom they had sworn allegiance? Nobody has seen your face since long, long ago.
<npc=21, part=3>
Second question. Why was your crown broken, and its parts scattered all over the Allod? My friends and I have collected the parts, and there is no doubt that it's the Crown of Yases.
<npc=21, part=4>
And the third question. Why...
<npc=2007, part=5>
Enough! You deserve death for your insolence...But I am in a generous mood, and you shall receive an answer to your first question. Yes, it is I, and here is my face!
<npc=2014, iammale, part=6>
Are you satisfied? Now, prepare to die, like I died all those years ago!!!

This is a total disgrace. This is an insult to the whole Allod! I say we take our revenge against the Necromancers' Guild for their deception! Yases shall rise against them!!!
