<npc=23, part=1>
I would like to talk to Talena after we save the town and meet her there. She could surely tell us lots of interesting things!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
I wouldn't mind listening to a couple of fairy tales either. Although, normally I would do it in a tavern, when a traveling bard comes by...
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
I can even fall asleep right at the table if he's really gifted!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Oh, those tales! Oh, those storytellers! I was once really embarrassed when one of those bards walked into a tavern and started his tales... 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
He was so smooth that I fell asleep without even noticing it. Very embarrassing.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
Well, that could be the case. However, most professional storytellers, commonly met in taverns, only succeed in inducing sleep.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
To their credit, sleeping to their tales is very relaxing!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
What do you want the stories for? It's all just nonsense, baloney and prejudice. Even real events get distorted beyond recognition!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
Thinking about becoming a character in such a story gives me the shivers.
<npc=23, part=4>
Don't mix up the traveling bards with serious people gathering ancient knowledge! I'm positive that Talena knows something that can help us!
<npc=21, iammale, part=5>
Okay, take it easy! I'm not prejudiced against Talena. I'd just be happy if she really tells us something useful.
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=5>
Okay, take it easy! I'm not prejudiced against Talena. I'd just be happy if she really tells us something useful.

Greetings, warrior! I beg you, help the people of this town if you are strong and good-hearted!

<npc=2022, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Greetings, colleague! I beg you, help the people of this town if you are strong and good-hearted!
<npc=2022, part=2>
They put their hope in me, but my knowledge of magic is not very useful in battle. It's a shame that I couldn't do anything for them.
<npc=21, iammale, part=3>
You're Talena, aren't you? I heard about you in Kaarg! My friends and I will be glad to help you!
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=3>
You're Talena, aren't you? I heard about you in Kaarg! My friends and I will be glad to help you!

Just so you know, the people of the town are not disappointed with you. In fact, they spoke very highly of you.

Greetings, sir Knight! I beg you, help the people of this town if your heart has not yet turned to stone!
<npc=2022, part=2>
They put their hope in me, but my knowledge of magic is not very useful in battle. It's a shame that I couldn't do anything more for them.
<npc=22, part=3>
You are Talena, aren't you? I heard about you in Kaarg! My friends and I will certainly aid you! 
<npc=22, part=4>
To soothe your conscience, know that the people are not disappointed with you. In fact, they spoke very highly of you.

<npc=2022, part=1>
You saved the people! You have earned both my respect and a reward.
<npc=2022, part=2>
I promise that I will repay this debt when we make it to my tower.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
Come on! You're about as rich as I am orcish. Keep your gold. You'll need it later...
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
What's this debt you're talking about? I wasn't asking for a reward from you!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
I do not need money as a reward for my assistance. Please keep your money to yourself and use it as you will.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
What debt?! I've probably got more money in my pocket than you've ever seen. Keep it! 
<npc=2022, part=4>
This reward doesn't resemble coinage. My wealth is different...
<npc=2022, part=5>
But we can discuss this later. For now, I must find the amulet that I lost while escaping from the orcs. I can't enter my tower without it!

<npc=2022, part=1>
This is all that's left of the town...The Orcs have no mercy for humans and their houses.
<npc=2022, part=2>
I am afraid that they have carried my amulet to their lair.

<npc=2022, part=1>
This is my amulet. We can go to my tower now!

======Talena talks to the hero
#event10
<npc=2022, part=1>
Thank you for your help! In return, I can tell something interesting. I believe that you will not become bored, despite the length of the story.
<npc=2022, part=2>
As you know, I study tales and legends. This has been causing problems with the Kaarg authorities, so I had to move out here to this tower.
<npc=2022, part=3>
It turned out to be blessing. You can learn a lot more about the past in the remote parts of Yases than in the capital...But back to the story. You have heard about the Source of Magic, haven't you?
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
Sure! The Great Mages supposedly used its force before the Cataclysm! But isn't that just a fairy tale?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
You mean the one that supposedly gave power to Great Mages before the Cataclysm? This was the favorite fairy tale of my granny!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
Of course! Everyone has heard about the Source of Magic that gave power to the Great Mages before the Cataclysm! I wish I could enter that fairy tale and touch the Source for myself!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
Certainly! The Great Mages supposedly used its force before the Cataclysm. I wish it weren't a fairy tale...I could use some of this Magic Source myself, right now.
<npc=2022, part=5>
I am convinced that some powerful magical structures built before the Cataclysm still exist. 
<npc=2022, part=6>
The Great Mages have decided to close some of them to prevent their misuse. One such Source must be here on Yases.
<npc=2022, part=7>
I was not the only one who reached this conclusion, but another relevant secret is known only to me. I have found a very old book containing yet another legend about Raminan, the Treasure Island. 
<npc=2022, part=8>
Unlike the Source of Magic, Raminan is a real fairy tale. Everybody tells stories, but no one in his right mind would actually go looking for it. 
<npc=2022, part=9>
The rendition of the legend of Raminan that I found was very similar to all others, with the exception of one thing...
<npc=2022, part=10>
The author mentioned that in some ancient language the word Raminan stands for "place where magic is born" - the Source of Magic!
<npc=2022, part=11>
It turns out that the mystery of the Source of Magic can be solved if both legends are thoroughly researched!
<npc=2022, part=12>
And that would take...well, I'm going to return to Kaarg. The authorities wouldn't care about a legend gatherer these days. We'll finish this conversation there.
