Listen, I have to ask you. How come you know nothing about the omen of the Three Stars? It's known everywhere on Yases, from the Eastern deserts to the Western woods.
<npc=21, iammale, part=2>
It is...well...I've lived on another Allod for a long time, and moved here just a short while ago.
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=2>

Huh! Maybe I've just befriended a Kanian spy then!

Huh! Maybe I've just befriended a Kanian spy then!
<npc=22, part=4>
Why are you silent? Sorry about that...I was making a joke, but it seems to have turned out to be offensive rather than funny.
<npc=21, iammale, part=5>
Oh no, I'm not offended. But just in case, I will answer this question seriously. I am NOT spying for the Kanian Empire. You have my word on it.
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=5>

=======Hero talks to the mayor of Ushut=======

<npc=2112, iammale, part=1>
I am the mayor of Ushut, and I am pleased to welcome such a noble traveler. May I ask what brings you here?
<npc=2112, iamfemale, part=1>
I am the mayor of Ushut, and I am pleased to welcome such a charming visitor. May I ask what brings you here?
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2 >
I heard that an old astrologer lives somewhere around here. I'd like to talk to him.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Maybe you can tell me where to find the old astrologer who lives around here? I would like to see him.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
I am looking for an astrologer of some years. He is supposed to live around here near your town.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2 >
Thanks for the compliment. But let's get down to business. I'm looking for an old astrologer who is rumored to live around here.
<npc=2112, part=3>
A strange detachment recently passed through our town. Actually, I would rather call them a gang. There were no noble warriors among them, and they acted like regular outlaws.
<npc=2112, part=4>
I didn't want to talk to them, but their chief showed me the Pennant of Death proving that they are on an official mission from the Necromancer Guild.
<npc=2112, part=5>
They, too, wanted to find the Astrologer, and I had to tell them how to find him: take the road up North and then turn right at the crossing.
<npc=2112, part=6>
I'm starting to worry about them now. I hope they don't hurt the Astrologer or Dina, his granddaughter. Maybe you can warn them?

<npc=2112, part=3>
Oh, you must have been sent to make sure that those people only do what they are supposed to!
<npc=22, part=4>
What do you mean, "those people"?

Hey you, blockhead, come over here! Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. You've got ten minutes.
<npc=2107, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=1>
Hey you foxy thing, come over here! Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. You've got ten minutes.
<npc=2107, iammage, iammale, part=1>
Hey juggler, come over here! Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. And make it fast! 
<npc=2107, iammage, iamfemale, part=1>
Hey foxy! You, wearing the magical junk! Come over here. Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. And make it fast!
<npc=21, iamfighter, iammale, part=2>
Gloves? I seriously doubt that's going to happen. But I can certainly make arrangements for you to suffer a slow and painful death!
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=2>
You sure are making a lot of noise. Maybe you'll quiet down some after I cut your throat!
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=2>
It is a pleasure to meet you, young man. I have been worrying about the lack of combat practice that I am receiving, and you present an excellent opportunity to fix this problem.
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=2>
What a funny little man! I should devise a funny little death for him.
<npc=2107, part=3>
Watch your mouth! I am on an official mission from the Necromancer Guild, and you will obey me if you don't want to disappoint them!
<npc=21, iamfighter, iammale, part=4>
I don't care about your mission. You're going to get what you deserve...now!
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=4>
I don't give a crap what happens to the Guild. But you should be worried about what I'm going to do to you right now!
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=4>
I am sorry, but I am going to have to disappoint them. Now, I must terminate your life for your insolence and gall!
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=4>
The Guild is my problem. Your problem is now with me!

Hey noble, come over here! Your mission: run back to the guys and bring me the gloves I left there. You've got ten minutes.
<npc=22, part=2>
The mayor must have been talking about this lad when he described the gang. Well, it's not going to take very long to finish him off, at least!
<npc=2107, part=3>
Watch your mouth, scum! I am on an official mission from the Necromancer Guild, and you will obey me if you don't want to disappoint them!
<npc=22, part=4>
You are cowardly as well as insolent! You hide behind a powerful protector when it comes to taking responsibility. You will now be taught your final lesson!

======Knight talks to Necro Interrogator=========
#event6
<npc=22, part=1>
Hey, who are you and what are you doing here? Where are the owners of this house? I want to see the Astrologer.
<npc=694, part=2>
Oh, I'm so sorry! Unknown bandits have just killed the Astrologer. My brothers in the Guild are now interrogating his granddaughter, Dina. As for me, I am looking for evidence.
<Npc=22, part=3>
Unknown bandits? Weren't they seen in Ushut?
<npc=694, part=4>
Yes, they were.
<Npc=22, part=5>
Interesting! The mayor of Ushut tells me that their chief has the Pinnacle of Death. Then I meet the chief by the bridge, and he says that he is on a mission from the Necromancer Guild. What do you say to this?
<npc=694, part=6>
Hmmm...In this case, I'd recommend immediately proceeding to our camp down south and testify. Until you do so, you should keep this secret.
<Npc=22, part=7>
Why should I need to do that!? You're trying to set me up, aren't you? Why would you want me to keep silent otherwise?
<npc=694, part=8>
You are very keen, sir. But I will make sure that you do not share your speculations with anyone!

<npc=21, part=2>
Open your eyes, idiot! Can't you see the Pinnacle of Death in my hand?
<npc=21, iamfighter, iammale, part=3>
Your chief sent me to pick up the old man's papers. I hope you haven't used them for starting a fire or anything else. He would be very disappointed if you did.
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=3>
Shut your mouth, and it'll keep your teeth protected! Your chief sent me to pick up the old man's papers. I hope you haven't used them for starting a fire. He would be very disappointed if you did.
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=3>
You will shut your mouth in my presence! Your chief has ordered me to hand him the old man's papers. Now MOVE!
<npc=21, iammage, iamfemale, part=3>
Shut up now! Your chief has ordered me to hand him the old man's papers. Move now, or I'll wash you in a sea of fire!
<npc=2104, iammale, part=4>
Uh...I'm sorry, sir. Right away, sir! May I ask where is our chief and when he is coming here?
<npc=2104, iamfemale, part=4>
Uh...I'm sorry, ma'am. Right away, ma'am! May I ask where is our chief and when he is coming here?

I don't know exactly where he is, but I am sure that you will join him soon.

<npc=22, part=1>
Don't be afraid, my girl! I will not hurt you, I want to help.
<npc=23, part=2>
How? Can you bring my grandpa back from the dead?
<npc=22, part=3>
All I can do for you is avenge his death. Those who commanded the assassins got what they deserved. But what did they want from you?
<npc=23, part=4>
The Necromancers wanted to find out what I know about my grandpa's observation of the falling of the Three Stars. It seemed very important to them!
<npc=22, part=5>
It is also important for me as well. Everything points at some dark mystery connected with the Fallen Stars, and it has to be solved. Trust me!
<npc=23, part=6>
The people who attacked our house took everything of value away. Grandpa's papers were among some other things.
<npc=23, part=7>
The bandits didn't think of telling the Necromancers about the papers, and I kept silent, as well. If you could only regain those papers!

I am a warrior, not a mage. I'm sorry, I can't do that.
<npc=21, iamfighter, iamfemale, part=3 >
I am sorry, but there is nothing I can do about that.
<npc=21, iammage, iammale, part=3 >
I am but a practicing mage rather than an omnipotent wizard. Unfortunately I cannot assist you with this request.

Then you may join me. My friend Igles and I have decided to discover where the Three Stars have fallen, and find them. Our quest is complicated and dangerous...

<npc=21, iammale, part=5>
I'm glad, partly because I can't read the papers I got from the bandits. The Astrologer was cautious, and he used secret symbols. Can you read any of this? Take a look!
