Maybe it was a mistake to trust a former brigand. This whole thing could be a vicious trap! I'd better be careful, I AM still a stranger here.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
If it turns out that this brigand fooled me and there's no treasure, he's going to regret it when I get back to town!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
It was probably a mistake to trust a former brigand. Perhaps, this whole thing is just a big trap! Nevertheless, I must attempt to obtain the gold. I'll need it for my journey!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
What if this treasure story IS just a story? If so, that brigand scum will pay for distracting me from my quest!

Halt, traveler! We guard the road, but we can't be responsible for those who wander into the forest!
<npc=2117, iamfemale, part=1>
Halt, lady! We guard the road, but we can't be responsible for those who wander into the forest!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
So, don't be responsible! If I return alive, there will be no problem. If I don't, nobody will be able to accuse you. At least I definitely won't be able to.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
I am not looking for someone to be responsible for me. I can take care of myself.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
I will take your warning into account. Nevertheless, I have some business in the forest.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
Then why do you carry those huge swords if all you can do is "not be responsible?" I can get along without you taking care of me, thank you very much.
<npc=2117, iammale, part=3>
Don't be so confident, lad! There are a lot of brigands in this forest. You should thank us for not letting them get out on the open road!
<npc=2117, iammale, part=4>
But it's your life, buddy. If you want to go and get yourself killed, go right ahead.
<npc=2117, iamfemale, part=3>
Don't be so confident, lass! There are a lot of brigands in this forest. You should thank us for not letting them get out on the open road!
<npc=2117, iamfemale, part=4>
But it's your life, lady. If you think you're so smart, you can go wherever you please.

====Talking to headman about corrupt guards
#event3
<npc=21, part=1>
Good day! Would you be able to tell me what is going on here? Why are there so many guards on the road?
<npc=2112, part=2>
Hello, stranger! There are brigands in the nearby forest, and the guards are supposed to be protecting us from them.
<npc=2112, part=3>
We doubt that the guards are really trying though. They haven't seized anyone for quite a while now. There's even talk that the brigands have paid-off some of them...
<npc=2112, part=4>
I don't know if it's true or not, but we villagers have learned to expect the worst.

<npc=2117, iammale, part=1>
So that was this man's business in the forest! He's returned with a sack full of gold!
<npc=2117, iamfemale, part=1>
So that was this woman's business in the forest! She's returned with a sack full of gold!
<npc=2117, iammale, part=2>
He must be the brigands' accomplice. Kill him!
<npc=2117, iamfemale, part=2>
She must be the brigands' accomplice. Kill her!

====We report the brigands to good guards
#event5
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=1>
I have good news for you, guards. The brigand camp that you've been looking for is nearby, up in the hills. It's pretty easy to find, actually!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
Hey, guys! You want to take care of the brigands, right? Their camp is nearby, up in the hills. It's pretty easy to get there from here.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
I have good news for you, guards. The brigand camp that you have been looking for is nearby, up in the hills. You should not have a difficult time finding it!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Hail, valorous guards! You weren't very nice to me the last time we met, but I'll do you a favor anyway. The brigand camp that you've been looking for is nearby, up in the hills beyond the lake.
<NPC=2117, part=2>
Thank you for the information! We will immediately check it out, but some of us will stay behind to protect the road.

====Corrupt guards harass the hero alone
#event6
<NPC=2117, iammale, part=1>
Damn! Thanks a lot, buddy! We had a great deal going with the forest guys, and then you come here and mess it up. Do you now what happens now?
<NPC=2117, iamfemale, part=1>
Damn! Thanks a lot, woman! We had a great deal going with the forest guys, and then you come here and mess it up. Do you now what happens now?
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
Jail, probably, or even capital punishment...Would you prefer to take the matter to the judge, or shall we settle this right here?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Well, you either let me go, or I carve you up like a holiday roast! Which would you prefer?
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
To the best of my knowledge of the law, it's either a jail or death sentence. Considering that the nearest court is far from here, I'll take my chances with the death sentence. Shall we begin?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
You'll find out soon enough! I intend to put a stop to your greedy ways once and for all!
