=======Start
#event1
<npc=21, part=1>
We have three options here. We can go straight to the fortress, or we can take the canyon paths and approach it from the north or the south.
<npc=21, part=2>
What do you say, Igles? You're supposed to be the military man here.
<npc=22, part=3>
I say that full reconnaissance of all routes must be completed prior to making the decision. Let's go.

<part=1>
Who are you? Who sent you here?
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
Who's talking? Who's asking? I can't see anyone!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
What kind of joke is this? Who is there? Show yourself!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
Who is talking? You must be cloaked with an invisibility spell. Would you please introduce yourself?
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
I would like to know who's asking. You are wrong if you think that I am surprised. The Invisibility spell isn't that uncommon nowadays.
<npc=694,iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
You are not supposed to see me, that is the objective of my mission. I watch Kshorg and his suite, awaiting the arrival of troops from Kaarg.
<npc=694,iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
I would fail my mission if I show myself. I watch Kshorg and his suite, awaiting the arrival of troops from Kaarg.
<npc=694,iammale, iammage, part=3>
Yes, I am on a surveillance mission to watch Kshorg and his suite, awaiting the arrival of troops from Kaarg.
<npc=694,iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
It works just the same, regardless of being common or not. I watch Kshorg and his suite, awaiting the arrival of troops from Kaarg. 
<npc=21, part=4>
Well, you'll have to wait no longer. The right to punish Kshorg has been granted to noble sir Igles and myself.
<npc=694, part=5>
Well, I shall soon give you directions then.

Who are you, sir Knight? Who sent you here?
<npc=22, part=2>
Who is asking? I can't see you, introduce yourself!
<npc=694 part=3>
Nobody is supposed to see me, that is the objective of my mission. I watch Kshorg and his suite, awaiting the arrival of troops from Kaarg.
<npc=22, part=4>
The right to punish Kshorg has been granted to me and my friends.
<npc=694, part=5>
Well, I shall soon give you directions then.
