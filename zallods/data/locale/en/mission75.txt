From what I managed to learn, Barross is supposed to live somewhere around here. I should mention that this wasn't easy to find out.
<npc=22, part=2>
I even had to bribe one of the scribes at the archives. I sincerely hope that he didn't mess anything up.
<npc=23, part=3>
Do you mean to say that we might have traveled all this way in vain, just because a scribe could have made a mistake?
<npc=21, part=4>
Well, he would deeply regret that if he did.

Greetings, good man! I'm looking for old knight Barross. I was informed at the Kaarg archives that he lives near here. Could you help me find him?
<npc=2024, part=2>
Barross was my father, but he died a while ago. He was found dead on the road, and it was declared a robbery despite the fact that none of his things were missing.
<npc=2024, part=3>
I guess the important people in the city have never bothered to ascertain his condition.  You may go back and tell them what has happened!
<npc=21, part=4>
Listen, lad! I'm sorry for your loss, but what's wrong with you? Do you order around everyone you meet, or are you just that rude?
<npc=2024, part=5>
My problem is none of your business! And now I'm not in the mood for talking!

Please forgive me for bringing up memories with this question...But you seem to be troubled with something else. What's your problem?

<npc=21, part=1>
Greetings, good man! I have some questions to ask you about old warrior Barross...
<npc=2112, part=2>
Well, he died quite a while ago, you know. His son lives east from here by the blacksmith. You can talk to him about this if you want.
<npc=2112, part=3>
Besides, tell him that his former girlfriend said hello, heh-heh...That might cheer him up.
<npc=21, part=4>
What is that strange amulet on your neck? 
<npc=2112, part=5>
Well, that's none of your business, friend. I'm not asking what kind of amulets or bracelets YOU are wearing, am I?

Greetings, sir Knight!

Greetings to you, good man. I have some questions to ask you about old warrior Barross...

<npc=2112, part=4>
When you talk to him, tell him that his former girlfriend said hello, heh-heh...That might cheer him up. He-he-har-har!!!
<npc=22, part=5>
What is that strange amulet on your neck? 
<npc=2112, part=6>
Oh, it's nothing, good sir...It looks impressive, but I bought it really cheap. It's not of any interest to a Lord such as yourself.

This is my business. I'd ask you to mind yours!

#event8
<npc=21, part=1>
Now I know why you're so angry! Your girlfriend left you for the silly old man who represents the authority in the village, am I right?
<npc=2024, part=2>
Yes, that's true. The headman enjoys torturing me. He ordered the guards not to let me approach my own girl! And I have no idea why she doesn't like me anymore.
<npc=21, part=3>
Well, I do. I noticed that the headman is wearing a strange amulet, which he refuses to talk about. But I know what it is anyway.
<npc=21, part=4>
The magic of this amulet allows its bearer to control other peoples minds. However, the bearer himself gradually becomes a servant of the creator of the amulet in return.
<npc=2024, part=5>
This amulet must be taken away from him! Then everything will become the same as it used to be...
<npc=21, part=6>
I could beat him up a little for you...I like that idea! That would teach him the proper conduct towards young girls!
<npc=2024, part=7>
No, no! There are a lot of guards in the village, they wouldn't allow the assault! Besides, he isn't going to be an easy man to catch...Perhaps, a noble Lord could approach him and rip the amulet off his neck!

Yes! I will rip this dangerous thing of his neck and destroy it!
<npc=2024, part=7>
That would be great! But please, don't attack the headman with weapons, good sir!
<npc=2024, part=8>
He is not guilty if he is indeed being controlled!

It's just wrong to abuse a girl in love that way! I'll fry that headman!

Hey, good man! I order you to come closer. Let me have that decoration of yours...
<npc=2112, part=2>
Guards! Help!
<npc=22, part=3>
Easy, you moron! I'm saving you!
<npc=2112, part=4>
A-a-a...E-e-e...H-r-r...Ouch...What was that? What happened to me? What did you do?
<npc=22, part=5>
I just took away and crushed the Amulet of Control that was around your neck. You could control other people by using it, but its maker could then control you!
<npc=2112, part=6>
Oh that's what it was...The Necromancers said that I could solve...er...a personal problem with it. I wasn't aware of its other properties!
<npc=2112, part=7>
Please don't punish me for raising my voice at you! I didn't know what I was doing!
<npc=22, part=8>
All right, I forgive you. But keep in mind that young girls aren't for old fools like you. Watch your step!

<npc=2024, part=1>
Thank you! What can I do for you in return?
<npc=22, part=2>
If you really want to do me a favor, tell me what you know about your father's expedition to the Source of Magic?
<npc=22, part=3>
More accurately, I need to know where to find the Source.
<npc=2024, part=4>
Father said that this is a big secret...But I have no secrets from you. The Source is on the island in the Dragon Lake, which is located on the edge of the desert.
<npc=2024, part=5>
However, no one can use it. It's protected by some sort of a spell.
<npc=22, part=6>
Perhaps, another legend holds this secret. I wish someone knew it...
<npc=2024, part=7>
Father had a good friend who knew lots of tales and legends. You might want to check with him.
<npc=22, part=8>
Thank you! You are a worthy son of your father! Have a good day!

I feel as if I've just come out of the fog! What am I doing here? Why did I obey this ugly man?
<npc=22, part=2>
Take it easy, it's all right now. The headman will never again pay more attention to you than is appropriate for a man of his age and position.
<npc=22, part=3>
I shall now escort you to someone who can't wait to see you again!
