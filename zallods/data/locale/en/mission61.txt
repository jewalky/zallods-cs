Village Under Attack

You must help to ward off the attacking Orcs from the village.
#subobjective0

#subobjective1
The Goblins are bothering the peasants as much as the Orcs are. Perhaps, they are the responsible party.
#subobjective2
The Orcs took an unexpected route. Defeat them!

#
==========Dina dies========

#

#

You were supposed to protect the peasants, not attack them! 
# 
=========We attack the knights =========

#
========The knights come to the village and talk to the headman 
#event1
<npc=2127, part=1>
Hey, where is the headman? We came to save you from the orcish assaults! 
<npc=2112, part=2>
We are so glad to see you! Life's getting worse here. You know, our village is on the desert frontier....
<npc=2127, part=3>
That's where we are going. By the way, there are a few people following us. Don't be afraid of them. They're sort of volunteers.
#
=======Start ========
#event2
<npc=2127, part=1>
I don't like it when someone is assigned to my regiment just because they have important relatives. I don't need such reinforcements!
<npc=22, part=2>
But my uncle said that you need swordsmen. Was he mistaken?
<npc=2127, part=3>
Let him command in town, but out here, I decide whom I need. Do whatever you want, I'm not interested in you, or in your companions.
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=4>
So much for making the effort. There's only one way to protect our honor now. We have to destroy the orcs before the Knights can do it.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=4>
What an outrageously arrogant moron! We can take care of these orcs faster than they can!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=4>
An uncomfortable situation indeed...Our only chance to avoid further humiliation is to take care of the orcs faster than these Knights.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=4>
Oh, this guy thinks he tough, huh? I wonder what he'll say when we clear the area better and faster than those illustrious Knights could ever hope? 
#
====Headman talks upon our arrival
#event3
<npc=2112, part=1>
The gallant Knights headed straight to the desert so fast that they didn't even asked where the orcs are coming from.
<npc=2112, part=2>
I don't know why they headed that way! The orcs never come from the sands, they always come from the forest to the North of our village.
#
====Headman talks upon victory.
#event4
<npc=2112, part=1>
My goodness! So sir Knight was mistaken! It was the volunteers who saved us. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts!
