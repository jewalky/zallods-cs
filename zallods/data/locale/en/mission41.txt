===Start
#event1
<npc=2015, part=1>
Well, my tower is up north. Normally, the heroes cross the river using the big bridge, and I stay here to wait for their return.
<npc=21, part=2>
What do you mean, "normally"? Aren't we the first to come here with you?
<npc=2015, part=3>
You aren't the first ones and you won't be the last...Does it make any difference? I hired you for a job. If you quit now, I'll make sure that no one on Yases will ever do business with you again!
<npc=22, part=4>
I have never once retracted my word, woman. The tower will be liberated as you ask! But if you persist in being so bold...I can't promise you my friendship!

===Mage killed
#event2
<npc=648, part=1>
Listen to me, humans! You turned out to be smarter than all the other food brought to me by my chambermaid!
<npc=648, part=2>
But if you think that I am going to abstain from dining, you are gravely mistaken!

===Dragon speaks when we approach his tower
#event3
<npc=648, part=1>
My dinner has arrived at last! I still haven't decided whether I should go deep fried or soaked in acid. Ah well, I'm sure I'll come up with something!

<npc=21, part=1>
We certainly aren't the first ones fooled by the Dragon's chambermaid! These sacks are probably the belongings of the less fortunate ones that came before us.
<npc=21, part=2>
Anyway, we kept our word and liberated the tower. That woman didn't lie to us either. Everything we encountered so far has tried to kill us!
