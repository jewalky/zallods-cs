"I met her in a jail cell in September;
I can still recall that purple dress she wore. 
She was smelling kind of funny in the twilight..."
<npc=21, part=2>
That's a good song. I just wish I could remember the next line!
<npc=22, part=3>
It's good that you forgot. Your delightful voice would scare off any orc!
<npc=21, part=4>
Don't you like my singing? You know, they have better singers at the palace...
<npc=23, part=5>
No offense, but you didn't get the notes exactly right. As a matter of fact, you completely blew the tune.
<npc=21, part=6>
So be it. I'll shut up then. Just don't ever ask me to sing for you again!
<npc=22, part=7>
Be assured that I won't. Now, if you're done...we ARE in a dangerous place here. We better concentrate on watching out for enemy attacks!

Greetings, wise Tekel. I have an important reason for disturbing you today. You are the only one who knows the magic phrase that I need to know!
<npc=2025, part=2>
It is a part of the forgotten legend about the Raminan island. 
<npc=2025, part=3>
Trust me, human, the Treasure Island does not exist. You would not have any use for the magic phrase.
<npc=2025, part=4>
Humans are a strange species indeed. Orcs are much more intelligent. Nevertheless...It will not hurt me to tell you this phrase.
<npc=2025, part=5>
Rotten desert sand flows like acid
A King dreams behind the throne
A mouse howls softly at the jeweled Moon
Above all, two walls of fire roar hungrily
<npc=21, part=6>
Thank you, o great Tekel, and goodbye!
