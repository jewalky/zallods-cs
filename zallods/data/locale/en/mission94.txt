======Start
#event1
<npc=694, part=1>
Finally! Here you are at last!
<npc=21, part=2>
Are you talking to me? Are you sure that you aren't confusing me with someone else?
<npc=694, part=3>
Frankly, I don't care if I am! I was never told that it would take this long! I have an order to wait until someone comes to the Dragon Lake. I'm to hand these magic books over to that person.
<npc=21, part=4>
Now what? Do I need to tell you a password or something?
<npc=694, part=5>
To hell with the password. It's been so long that I forgot it myself. Just take these books and let me finally leave this place...
#
======dina feels activation of the teleport.
#event2
<npc=23, part=1>
Something has changed...I feel something! Perhaps, a teleport was activated?
#
======Hero about direction.
#event3
<npc=21, part=1>
What a strange feeling! I am absolutely sure that we must move south. I wish I knew where this sureness comes from. 
#
======Hero about puzzle.
#event4
<npc=21, part=1>
This is the place! The magic phrase says...
<npc=21, part=2>
If you manage approaching a horrid and secret location, Build a wall at the sign, and another to follow the prime. Third one shall bind them together across like a pillar, Thus be revealed an enigma forgotten of old.
<npc=21, part=3>
What baloney! Forgive me, o Great Mages! How am I supposed to decipher that?
#
======Hero talks to earth pyramid.
#event5
<npc=2029, part=1>
You managed to reach the place not visited by humans for centuries! It is within my power to give you whatever you desire. What do you want? Strength? Power? Gold?
<npc=21, part=2>
No, this is not what I need. I have strength, I don't need power, and money comes easily enough.
<npc=21, part=3>
I only ask for justice. I am a stranger on the Allod of Yases, and maybe that's the reason I can easily see the lack of it. 
<npc=21, part=4>
This is my desire!
<npc=2029, part=5>
Unfortunately, this is not within my power. But I can give you the strength to return justice to Yases yourself!
