<npc=22, part=1>
The outlaws' camp should be somewhere around here. I can't wait till I meet this dirty scoundrel again...this time in battle!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
I understand your feelings, but we are few. What if there is a big force in the camp?
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
I have another plan. Why don't we try to find the local Druids? I doubt that they enjoy their neighbors, so they might be willing to help us.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
Try using your brain before you go charging into battle! Have you an idea how many outlaws there are in the camp? They could have a whole army while we are just a few!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
My plan is to find the local Druids. I doubt that they enjoy their neighbors, so they should be willing to help us.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
It would be too reckless. We have no reliable intelligence about the enemy, while our own force is limited.
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
I would suggest seeking the local Druids first. It would be logical for them to be unhappy about the outlaws living in their woods! They may be willing to assist us.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
Sure, you're possessed with a righteous wrath...But would you care to notice, Igles, that there are few of us. Have you any idea how many outlaws there are? I knew you didn't!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
That's why I suggest using a little trick. Let's find the local Druids, They should offer their help if they're not happy with the outlaw living in their woods!

A warrior from the Plains isn't a common encounter in our woods! But when you meet one, it can be very helpful.

<npc=690, part=2>
My problem is one you can solve. There is a sacred place in the southwest called the Standing Rocks. It seems that a harpy has decided to call the Rocks its home! 
<npc=690, part=3>
All harpies are evil-tempered, and this one is particularly nasty. I have had no success in making it obey my will or leave.
<npc=690, part=4>
I can not kill it because that would defile the sacred place. But since you are from the Plains, you are not bound by our customs.

The sacred place has been cleared! This is good news, and good news is worth a reward...

#event6
<npc=687, part=1>
I know who you are! Yole-Maye informed me that you traveled with the chief of the outlaws. That was a big mistake, young lady!
<npc=687, part=2>
You look so young and innocent, but you managed to deceive Yole-Maye himself! You shall suffer for this!
<npc=23, part=3>
This is not true! I swear I have never deceived anyone! Neither my friends nor I knew that this traveler was an outlaw!
<npc=23, part=4>
My friends and I have returned to correct this mistake. If you Druids hate the outlaws so much, we should raid their camp together!
<npc=690, part=5>
It seems that you were honest in saying that you didn't know who your companion was. Otherwise, it would have taken Yole-Maye next to no time to sense your deception.
<npc=690, part=6>
I will give you reinforcements to help you correct your mistake. But they will be watching you! You will face our wrath if it turns out that you have lied to us!

You managed to deceive us, but you shall face the consequences now!

<npc=687, iamfemale, part=2>

<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=3>
You are right. We agreed to accompany that traveler. But I swear we didn't know he was an outlaw!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=3>
I plead guilty of travelling with him, but I have never deceived anyone! I swear we didn't know this traveler was an outlaw! 
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=3>
Our actions deserve condemnation, but please also take into consideration that we were misled! No one suspected that our companion was an outlaw!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=3>
I was not going to join them or anything! Yes, we made a mistake, but who could suspect that this man was an outlaw?
<npc=21, part=4>
My friends and I have returned to correct this mistake. If you Druids hate the outlaws so much, we should raid their camp together!

<npc=687, part=1>
I know who you are! Yole-Maye informed me that you traveled with the chief of the outlaws. That was a big mistake, Knight! 
<npc=687, part=2>
You are a cunning and treacherous man. You managed to deceive us, but you shall face the consequences now!
<npc=22, part=3>
Your words hurt me because you don't blame just me, you blame all the Knights of Kaarg.
<npc=22, part=4>
I am guilty, but I have not deceived anyone! I swear I didn't know the man was an outlaw!
<npc=23, part=5>
Now my friends and I returned to compensate for this blunder.  If you druids hate the outlaws so much, we should raid their camp together! 
<npc=690, part=6>
It seems that you were honest in saying that you didn't know who your companion was. Otherwise, it would have taken Yole-Maye next to no time to sense your deception.
