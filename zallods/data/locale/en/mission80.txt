#failure2 
Igles was right. The heat isn't the most harmful thing for a hero in this place! 
#

=======Starting conversation ====
#event1
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=1>
Boy is it hot here! I bet I don't even have to fight. The evil stench of my armpits will scare off the Orcs instead!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=1>
How entertaining it is to wander in the sands in such heat...I can feel my body cooking in the sun!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
I have found a serious gap in my magical knowledge: I can not protect myself from this stifling heat.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Damn! My makeup will melt in this heat!
<npc=22, iammale, part=2>
I'm glad that this is the only thing you worry about. However, we're going to be facing problems far more serious than sweating!
<npc=22, iamfemale, part=2>
I agree that this is a dangerous for us, however, we're going to be facing other problems soon enough!
#
=======Hero takes the second piece ====
#event2
<npc=21, part=1>
No wonder the Orcs cherished their Yelooy-shaman! He must have looked like a god to them with this thing on his neck...
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
Now for the easy part...getting out of here as fast as we can. I hope that there's nothing left for us here. I'm quite fed up with the orcs now!
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
As a matter of fact, he looks even better dead. Getting out of here alive and in good health should be easy now!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
Regardless of how he looked before, he seems rather peaceful now. As for us, we should depart from this place as quickly as we can.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
We should get out of here as fast as we can now. I'm quite fed up with the orcs now!
#
=======Igles takes the second piece ====
#event3
<npc=22, part=1>
So this is the Second Star...Let those dirty, orcish claws never touch it again!
#
=======Dina takes the second piece========
#event4
<npc=23, part=1>
It's so beautiful...Our quest was indeed worth this!
#
=======Hero takes the last piece =======
#event5
<npc=21, iamfighter, part=1>
Our quest is over! I'm not a mage, but even I can feel the parts of the crown trying to pull themselves together...
<npc=21, iammage, part=1>
Our quest is over! I can actually feel the parts of the crown trying to pull themselves together...
#
=======Igles takes the last piece======
#event6
<npc=22, part=1>
Our quest is over! I'm not a mage, but even I can feel the parts of the crown trying to pull themselves together. I never dreamed that I could hold the real Crown of Yases!
#
======Dina takes the last piece ======
#event7
<npc=23, part=1>
The parts of the Crown are trying to pull themselves together...I can't believe that I, a plain country girl, will soon behold the Crown of Yases!
