<npc=21, part=1>
Hmm...It's nice here. I'm glad that the storyteller lives here instead of somewhere in the sands, or in the barren Necromancer lands.
<npc=21, part=2>
Flowers, trees, sheep herds...I should seriously consider dropping Skrakan's quest and staying here to live out my life!
<npc=22, part=3>
This place is too peaceful and tranquil for you. If I know you at all, you wouldn't be able to stay here for more than a week, at the most!
<npc=23, part=4>
Well, I could live here...But I'm afraid that this peacefulness is deceitful!

#event2
<npc=21, part=1>
Greetings, good man! I am looking for the old storyteller who lives in your village...
<npc=2112, part=2>
It is so good that you came here! Help us please! The wolves are devouring our sheep.
<npc=2112, part=3>
Our village will starve if we lose more than a third of the herd!
<npc=21, part=4>
Well, I was asking about the storyteller, not about your sheep...
<npc=2112, part=5>
Who cares about stories when famine is knocking on our door...
<npc=21, part=6>
Okay, I get it. But keep in mind, peasant, I'll be really disappointed if you continue to evade my questions after I get rid of these wolves!

Greetings, good sir! It is so good that you came here! Help us please! The wolves are devouring our sheep.
<npc=2112, part=2>
Our village will starve if we lose more than a third of the herd!
<npc=22, part=3>
Look, good man! I have no intention of fighting wolves. I came here looking for the old storyteller who lives in your village.
<npc=2112, part=4>
Who cares about stories when famine is knocking on our door, good sir? 
<npc=22, part=3>
Okay, alright! I'll take care of these wolves for you. But you keep in mind why I am here!

<npc=2112, part=3>

<npc=23, part=4>
Yes, of course I shall help you! I used to live in a village and I know how terrible it can be to lose your livelihood!
<npc=23, part=5>
But I actually came here looking for the old storyteller...
<npc=2112, part=6>
Oh, lass! Who cares about stories when famine is knocking on our door...

======Headman talks to hero part II
#event5
<npc=21, part=1>
Well, the wolves are gone. It wasn't that hard to do.
<npc=2112, part=3>
Even so, we are so grateful to you.
<npc=21, part=4>
Oh, don't mention. Ok, so where does the storyteller live?
<npc=2112, part=5>
He died, I'm afraid. But maybe I can help you? I used to listen to the storyteller a lot, and I have a very good memory.
<npc=21, part=6>
I'm sorry to hear that, my friend.
<npc=21, part=7>
I wanted to hear the tale about the island of Raminan. It contains a magic phrase in the story somewhere. Actually, it's just the phrase that I need. Do you remember it?
<npc=2112, part=8>
Sure! It sounds strange though.
<npc=2112, part=9>
If you manage approaching the horrid and secret location,
Build a wall at the sign, and another to follow the prime.
Third one shall bind them together, across like a pillar,
Thus be revealed an enigma forgotten of old.
<npc=21, part=10>
Great! Thank you very much!
