<npc=21, part=1>
All orcs look the same to me. How am I supposed to find this Minge-Shaman among them? 
<npc=22, part=2>
That's a tough question. I think that this shaman must be very old. He probably wouldn't try to attack us.
<npc=22, part=3>
We should be careful not to kill him accidentally in the heat of the battle!

======Ogre talks

<npc=617, part=1>
Wow! I lay here about to die, and humans cure me! I never hear anything like this...
<npc=617, part=2>
I healthy and strong again. It is good. Drop in if you get to our place. My family would be glad to see you.

#event4
<npc=656, part=1>
Aahh, human, I old Minge-Shaman, very-very want to live!!! I very surrender! Stand silent and hands up!!!
<npc=21, part=2>
So you're a bright guy, shaman! Didn't take you long to realize that we aren't joking around here!
<npc=21, part=3>
Since you want to live, tell me where to find the Source of Magic? And don't try to pull any trick on me!
<npc=656, part=4>
I tell-tell all, no nonsense! Source on island, island in Dragon Lake, lake in far end of desert. But no-no way to reach Source.
<npc=656, part=5>
It need a puzzle to solve-solve, a ritual to do-do to pass.
<npc=21, part=6>
What puzzle? What ritual?
<npc=656, part=7>
Tekel knows what ritual. Minge-shaman old-old, ill, miserable, knows not more. Told you all I know-know!
<npc=21, part=8>
Well, that's not what I call information overload. I should return to the city and get Talena's advice.

Well, it turns out that the shaman didn't know much. I should return to the city and get Talena's advice.
