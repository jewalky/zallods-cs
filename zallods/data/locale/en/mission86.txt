<npc=21, part=1>
Greetings! I'm looking for a mage named Wordock. Can you help me with that?
<npc=697, part=2>
Don't you know what he looks like?
<npc=21, part=3>
No.
<npc=697, part=4>
Well, I'm Wordock! What can I do for you? And what can you do for me? 
<npc=21, part=5>
Hmm...But I was told that you were following the Druid way.
<npc=697, part=6>
It was my mistake. Later I realized that Necromancery is the only art that can make me happy!
<npc=21, part=7>
I wouldn't argue about that. I wanted to ask you to tell me the legend of the island of Raminan...
<npc=697, part=8>
Yes, yes, sure, certainly! But there is a condition: destroy all of the monsters on the hill north of here, and then you may hear any legend you want!

I have satisfied your request!
<npc=697, part=2>
Great. Now no one will prevent me from doing as I please! Thanks, and goodbye.
<npc=21, part=3>
Wait a second...You promised to tell me about the Treasure Island!
<npc=697, part=4>
The Treasure Island does not exist! End of tale. Now get lost while you can, fool! You should have been smarter, ha-ha-ha! You've got ten seconds to leave, or else!

#event8
<npc=21, part=1>
I'm looking for a mage named Wordock...Unsuccessfully so far. Could you help me?
<npc=685, part=2>
Maybe I can, maybe I can't. Wordock doesn't trust everyone who asks. Who told you that he lives here?
<npc=21, part=3>
Talena. She also asked to say hello to him. 
<npc=685, part=4>
Talena? Well, she wouldn't open my secret to just any person...I am Wordock. What brings you here?
<npc=21, part=5>
My friends and I need to hear one of the legends about Raminan, the Treasure Island. 
<npc=685, part=6>
It doesn't take long to tell a legend...But since you are here, I would ask you for a favor. 
<npc=685, part=7>
Armed people have occupied the edge of the swamp. I don't know who they are, I just know that their chief goes under my name!
<npc=685, part=8>
I would very much like to get rid of their presence. The animals that obey me can't overcome those people on their own.
<npc=685, part=9>
But together you can destroy them!

The impostor is dead!
<npc=685, part=2>
Great! So, you wanted to hear a legend about the Raminan island, didn't you? Which one do you want?
<npc=21, part=3>
Hmm...I don't know the title. It should contain a magic phrase, one that sounds like a riddle.
<npc=685, part=4>
Yes, there is a riddle in one of them. Mind you, I don't know the answer to it. Here it is...
<npc=685, part=5>
Two idols are standing by the ring,
They wanted to see each other's thing.
The obstacle contains no issue.
Your magic should destroy its tissue.
<npc=21, part=6>
Thank you, Wordock!

Greetings, respected Druid! I'm looking for a mage named Wordock. If you tell me how to find him...
<npc=685, part=2>
Very interesting. First, you kill my forest friends, and now you call me "respected Druid" and ask for help? I'm surprised by your insolence, and my own patience!
<npc=21, part=3>
I'm sorry! I thought they were wild beasts...Talena had warned me that this place is isolate and dangerous!
<npc=685, part=4>
Talena? Do you know her?
<npc=21, part=5>
Yes, she told me where to look for you, and she says hello. She said that you might know the legend about Raminan that I need to hear.
<npc=685, part=6>
Is this so? Frankly, with all due respect to Talena, I have no desire to do anything for you!
<npc=21, part=7>
Can I somehow make up for my mistake?
<npc=685, part=8>
All right. Armed people have occupied the edge of the swamp. I don't know who they are, I just know that their chief goes under my name! 
<npc=685, part=9>
