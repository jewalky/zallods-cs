Build and muscle power.#The higher the body level, the stronger#a character is, the better health condition #he/she has and the more damage he/she can inflict.
Agility, or reaction level.#The better the reaction of a character,#the faster he/she will move,#the better he/she will avoid blows,#carry out precise attacks, and the#bigger the sight range he/she will have.
The ability of logical thinking and decision-making.#Mind power affects the learning ability of the character,#the rate at which new skills are acquired,#and the power of magical spells when cast.
Magic ability and magic resistance.#The higher the spirit, the greater#the amount of Mana a Mage can accumulate.#For a Warrior, it affects magic resistance only.
Health is the vitality of the character.#The higher the health level,#the more damage a character#may sustain before passing out.
Mana is the amount of magical power#a character possesses. The larger the#amount of Mana a character has accumulated,#the more complicated and powerful are#the spells he/she can cast.
Damage is the amount of injury which#a character can inflict upon an enemy#by one hit. This attribute depends upon the body#of a character and its armament.
The precision of a character's attack. The higher it is,#the higher the probability of a successful attack.#The probability of hitting unprotected body parts increases as well.
Absorption will reduce the total number#of damage points being received by the#character from an enemy/friendly attack.
The ability to avoid receiving damage.#Defense level depends on agility,#armor, weapons and magic.
The total weight of the items worn#and owned by a character.#It affects the speed of the character.
Sight. It is a radius around the#character, within which that character#is able to see the surrounding terrain,#buildings and other characters.
The speed of movement of the character on#the terrain. The character's speed depends upon#the character's agility rating#and can be increased by magic items or spells.
The skill of wielding various types of#weapons or magic spheres. The skills#increase in proportion to their use.#The higher the skill the#more difficult it will be to increase it.
Resistance to a certain magic sphere shows#the percentage of the magical effects of this#particular sphere which will not affect the character.
Experience is the sum total of all the knowledge, abilities and#skills that a character has acquired throughout the game.#The growth of the experience is mainly due to#victories over enemies and monsters.
Daggers, Short Swords, Long Swords,#Bastard Swords, and Two-handed Swords.##Their advantage is in high precision of attack#and a short interval between attacks.
Axes and Two-handed Axes.##The interval between axe attacks#is quite long and depends on the weapon weight,#but it inflicts the most damage.
Clubs, Spiked Clubs,#Maces, Cudgels, and Morningstars.##Clubs are considerably cheaper#than the other weapons but still #inflict a substantial amount of damage.
Spears and Halberds.##They possess good battle attributes,#plus they provide a bonus #to the defense of the wielder.
Bows and Crossbows.##Shooting weapons that enable #distant attacks. Flying enemies #can only be hurt by these weapons.
The Fire Sphere##All of the heat damage spells belong to the Fire Sphere:#Fire Arrow, Fire Ball, Wall of Fire and Protection from Fire.
The Water Sphere##Water transformations prevail in the Water Sphere:#Ice Missile, Poison Fog, Blizzard and Protection from Water.
The Air Sphere##The Air Sphere draws its effects out of thin air:#Lightning, Prismatic Spray, Invisibility and Protection from Air.
The Earth Sphere##The Earth Sphere uses the power of earth and stone:#Stone Missile, Wall of Stone, Stone Curse and Protection from Earth.
The Astral Sphere##The magic of Astral is the most complicated#and least studied of the magics. There is#characteristically no protection#against Astral magic. Its spells are:#Bless, Haste, Heal, Drain Life, Shield,#Summon, Animate Dead and Teleport.
