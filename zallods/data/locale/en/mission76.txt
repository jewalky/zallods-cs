<npc=22, part=1>
As far as I know, a group of former mercenaries is attempting to take over this part of the Woods.
<npc=22, part=2>
They made a secret agreement with the authorities where they would be able to control this land if they manage to force the Druids to leave.
<npc=22, part=3>
However, officially the mercenaries are not in any way connected with the government.
<npc=22, part=4>
We can take advantage of this and respond to their attack without worrying about retaliation from the authorities.

Greetings, guest of the Woods! How may I help you?
<npc=21, part=2>
I have important business with the Druid who participated in the journey to the Source of Magic. Do you know how can I find him?
<npc=687, part=3>
You will find him if you continue down this road. But be careful!
<npc=687, part=4>
Strange hunters have appeared in our forest. They've been capturing or scaring away the animals in the Woods. It's as if they want to turn our forest into a lifeless desert!
<npc=21, part=5>
I think I know who you're talking about...Anyway, thanks for the warning!

Greetings, good woman! I'm here to learn about the Source of Magic. That is, if nothing prevents you from talking about it.
<npc=822, part=2>
I don't know the secret of the Source, mind you. But the rest of it I can talk about. Why do you need this information?
<npc=21, part=3>
My friends and I are going to return order to this Allod! The Source can help us with that.
<npc=822, part=4>
You may be concerned with the whole Allod, but I have enough worries with just this part of the Woods!
<npc=822, part=5>
Some strange people are bothering us. They're hunters or outlaws or something...How can I be concerned with the Allod while there is no peace in my forest?
<npc=21, part=6>
Relax, I can handle that. I have experience dealing with these sort of people!

#event8
<npc=21, part=1>
There are no more reasons for you to worry! The outlaws are gone and they won't be back.
<npc=21, part=2>
Can we talk about the Source now that you know this?
<npc=822, part=3>
I am grateful to you, but this business is not over yet. The local monsters were so infuriated with the outlaw's raids that they don't obey me anymore!
<npc=822, part=4>
I have spent a lot of time taming the ogres who live in the northwestern rocks. When I finally succeeded, I entrusted them with growing a rare mountain plant for me.
<npc=822, part=5>
I am afraid of going there now. One blow on the head would knock me out cold. But I need this plant badly!
<npc=21, part=6>
You know, you could have mentioned this earlier! Anyway...We can go to the rock together. I'll take care of the ogres for you.

======Smart druid talks to hero final
#event11
<npc=822, part=1>
Frankly, I did not think I could trust you, the first moment I saw you. I have been giving you these tasks to determine whether you are truly worthy of knowing the secret of the Source.
<npc=21, part=2>
Really? Why didn't you say so in advance?!
<npc=822, part=3>
Because I wanted to make sure that you can do good deeds without expecting a reward for them. I am glad that you did not disappoint me.
<npc=822, part=4>
The Source of Magic is located on an island in the middle of the Dragon Lake. However, you must know some sort of spell to use it. I have no idea what that spell might be. Wait a second...
<npc=822, part=5>
For no particular reason, I just remembered a man named Wordock. He has followed the Druid way since he was a young man, and he was my apprentice for a few years.
<npc=822, part=6>
He knows a lot of the old tales, one of which may very well be the key to the Source. But neither he, nor I know which one it is.

Don't be offended, Knight! You know that trusting the wrong person might cost you dearly. I am glad that you did not disappoint me.
