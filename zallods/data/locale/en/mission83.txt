======= Start =========
#event1
<npc=23, part=1>
You can imagine what I feel if the Orcs are uncomfortable here! I've got goosebumps all over!
<npc=21, iammale, iamfighter, part=2>
Why don't you stay here then? We are not forcing you to come with us, you know. 
<npc=21, iamfemale, iamfighter, part=2>
You should have thought about it before! Well, if your knees are shaking, stay here and don't move. Nobody's kicking your butt to make you come with us! 
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=2>
Low morale dramatically degrades performance in complicated environments. From my perspective, you should stay here and avoid motion.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=2>
No wonder, darling, you are still a little baby, especially compared to me. You can stay here if you're scared.
<npc=22, part=3>
Now cut that out! Don't be discourteous with Dina if you don't want to have a problem with me too!
<npc=22, part=4>
She can decide what to do by herself. Besides, it's way scarier to stay here alone than to go with us.
#
======= Finish ======
#event2
<npc=21, iamfighter, part=1>
That's it then. There wasn't anything so scary in that Stone Web. Well, maybe there was, but there certainly isn't anymore!
<npc=21, iammale, iammage, part=1>
After a close examination, the perils of the Stone Web turned out to be fairly harmless.  Besides that, our visit has considerably reduced their quantity.
<npc=21, iamfemale, iammage, part=1>
Gone are the horrors of the Stone Web! Nothing left to scare poor Dina! Heh heh!
