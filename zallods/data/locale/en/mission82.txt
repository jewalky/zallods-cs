The Elite Knights

You must destroy the elite Knights, specially trained for fighting against mages.
#
==Hero dies====
#failure2 
Not only mages fall prey to these cutthroats.
#
===Igles dies===
#failure3 
The boldest of all Knights will die if he becomes careless in battle!
#
======== Dina dies =======  
#failure4
Dina's magic was futile against the cutthroats' protection.
#
========== Start ==========
#event1
<npc=21, iammale, part=1>
You may say whatever you want, but I like it here! You don't have to worry about trying to find your way around. There's just one road ahead, and it's straight as an arrow's flight!
<npc=21, iamfemale, part=1>
Why are we standing here, deciding which direction to travel when there's just one road to follow!
<npc=22, part=2>
There's nothing to wait for indeed. I would just warn Dina once again to stay behind us. Your magic may fail you here.
<npc=23, part=3>
Yes, I remember that. But please be careful, too! These soldiers are trained to fight mages, but that doesn't mean that they are weak in regular battles.
#
========== Finish ========
#event2
<npc=23, part=1>
I can't believe it's over! This campaign seemed endless!
<npc=21, part=2>
Same here. It's time to get out of this place!
